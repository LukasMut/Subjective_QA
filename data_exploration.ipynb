My Mum arranged for us to stay at The Fairmont from The UK. On arrival we were blown away - compared to where we had stayed the night before! The entrance is beautiful! We were given a corner tower room on the 12th floor for our first night which was wonderful, we had amazing views of the city, for our second night we were lucky enough to stay in the suite on the 12th floor. This was all thanks to Ana who did an incredible job on the reception desk and we can truely say that she made the final part of our honeymoon unforgettable. The suite was out of this world, we had views of the city and of the bay! Just wonderful! I cannot say a bad word about this hotel. I would love to stay again!!!Thanks Again Ana! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The Numi packaging and advertising is a little over the top, but that shouldn't take away from the tea. Pu'erh tea goes through a 60 day fermentation process, so it's not going to be a flowery fluffy desserty type of a tea.There are hints of cardamom in this, but just like theGinger Pu'erh Tea Bags, 16-CountI have a hard time finding spiciness in the flavor.The package contains 16 individually sealed non-GMO biodegradable tea bags. The outside container has a perforated area at the bottom, so if you gently press through the part on the front of the packaging, you get a nice re-closeable box for the tea bags. The package includes an expiration (\"Best Before End\") date.The inside flap includes a recipe. This one is for a jelly, the Ginger for iced tea. I opened the box using the perforation so I didn't even realize there was a recipe in the inside flap. A quarter-size sticky keeps the flap attached to the main box, so you don't even have to open it that way unless you want the recipe.Every tea bag has a small indentation, a hint as to where to tear it open. Each bag includes brewing instructions (3 to 5 minutes). But I was disappointed that each tea bag is attached to its string with a small staple. I am sure there are better ways of doing this without the need for staples!Being stingy, I can get two 8oz cups of tea from each tea bag. Obviously the first one is stronger but because this is a strong and dark tea, the second cup still looks dark. I steep the first time for 3 minutes (using a timer). Given its strength, this is good as iced tea as well.The package says that it has higher caffeine but it doesn't provide a number. I usually get a caffeine kick from coffee, but I did not get a kick from this one. Caffeine-wise, it felt like green tea. Some people claim that tea caffeine is slower to enter the bloodstream than coffee caffeine, and tea typically has less caffeine than coffee. This certainly explains my reaction to it but caffeine reaction varies, so it's hard to tell how it will affect others. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This book was so freakin' sweet, but not in the typical sweet way. They're not privileged people who have a few issues and end up getting together with a nice happily ever after. No. They have issues and it broke my heart! It's hard to believe what they had to go through, especially Ella, and it proves to me just how strong they are.Ella and Micha didn't come from the best neighborhood. It's not exactly a place you want to grow up in with drug dealings and other criminal activities taking place just around the corner. Pair that with her father's drinking habit and her mother's illness, you come to see why Ella had the life she did. And after we learn everything she had to go through and why she decided to go off to college, I had the utmost admiration for Ella. Her strength is beyond belief. She still has things to work through, and she is nowhere near perfect, but she's finally trying to face her problems and that's what I like about her.As for Micha...*fans self* Man he is one sexy character! I wish I got to know more about him, but he plays that bad-boy-with-a-heart role to a T! He has the full check list of piercings, tattoos, musician, etc. The whole bit! But he also has his soft side. The side that is completely and utterly in love with Ella and it makes you swoon big time! Gah! He was great :)I also loved the plot to the story. It was the perfect way to show how they needed each other to work through what life has handed them. I thought it was executed wonderfully. The only thing that could have improved were if there were maybe some more flashbacks. I was told that these characters have known each other forever, and I believe it (what with all the pent up sexual tension that had built through the years) but I wish I knew these characters a little more. They were developed, but it could of used just a little bit more development in order for me to truly understand their attraction/connection.Hmm...so I guess that's all I have to say. This was a sweet, sexy, and quick read that I highly recommend! I can't wait for the next book simply because I love these characters so much! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Went on a Thursday and the half priced martinis were delish!  I had the chicken and waffles which tasted amazing.  Portion size was just right. Waffles were a bit soggy and the presentation was a kind of odd with the slaw just slopped on top.  Overall though I was very satisfied with my meal!  I would definitely get it again. The restaurant itself is quite narrow and small - so I wouldn't  recommend for very large groups. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The Thai food scene in Toronto has taken off lately. If you are aching for some really good Thai food, this place might not be for you. Having that said, Salad king is a fine place for a bite for run-of-the-mill Thai dishes.My favourite dish here is their golden curry which is quite tasty. Prices are cheap and you can get a decent dish for around $12-13 (after tax+tip)The place is quite busy on weekends, and it is almost always quite loud. Communal seating in the middle of the restaurant can be charming and annoying at the same time.A thing I do notice here is that service tends to be slow. Food comes fast once you ordered, but the hard part is waiting for your server....and the same happens when you want to pay. If you are in a rush and think this is a place for a quick meal, you might be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: My wife and I went to SF for a medical conference for 2 days. We stayed in a tower room and had a nice view of the city. The room was clean and nice and the bathroom was fancy. The water pressure was fantastic and there was plenty of hot water available. The bed was one of the most comfortable king sized beds we've stayed in. The room service was out of this world. Highly recommend getting coffee and chocolate cake delivered to your room in the evening. Took about 15 minutes at most. Great service from the concierge desk finding a quick lunch at a place that wasn't filled with tourists. And looking at the old pictures and menus was quite fun. We had a nice dinner at the Tonga room where a simulated thunderstorm occurs about every 20 minutes and the center of the restaurant is a small pool where the band plays on a boat which floats in the pool. The food was tremendous. Get the appetizer sampler plate. Really good! One issue is that if you stay for any length of time, buy a multiday cable car pass as it is a steep walk down the hill several blocks to the nearest shopping at Union Square, which we both do recommend. If you ride the cable car all the way down to Market Street it puts you right in front of the mall. The stores are huge and lots of selection. We ate ate at the Nob Hill Cafe, which was good for lunch and weekend brunch. The cab fare from the Airport is $40 which I recommend from a convenience standpoint, but if you know when you want to go back to the airport, arrange for the airporter through the concierge desk, it's only $15 per person and they make only one stop between the Fairmont and the Airport, at least when we rode it. They have adjoining room situations which might be fine for kids, but we didn't bring ours to this conference. This is a really neat hotel. Enjoy just sitting in the lobby and look at all the fancy decorations and people that go there for special events. We will go back in the near future. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Today we are trying the special here. It has a little bit of all of their signature dishes. Let's dive right into the review.Wow does the food look fancy. The food was placed in small independent bowls and they fit nicely on a wooden plate. A lot of my co-workers say that this place has one of the best a la carte in Toronto and I can agree. There were some pieces of fish that I didn't enjoy but I generally enjoyed it. I especially like the fried shrimp but they only give 1 :(Great service at this restaurant. The place itself looked very classy and everybody there was well dressed, while I was proudly enjoying my meal in my jeans and sweater on the other hand.In terms of value, I paid around 40 dollars for the meal. Just to warn you beforehand, if you are a short average looking male, this meal will definitely not fill you up. I went during lunch time too so I can't begin to imagine how much this would cost at dinner.Overall, the food here is a good try but I don't see myself coming back. The amount of food I recieved was way too little for the amount that I paid for. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: My favourite ramen place so far over sansotei, kinton, kenzo, etc. It is located in a relatively quiet street behind yonge dundas square and eaton centre so it may be a bit hard to find at first. Every time I come here I keep thinking that its the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. I often change up what ramen I get but the consistency of the delicious rich and flavourful broth and the firm yet chewy noodles. Seriously, its so good. Service there is always fantastic, definitely up to Japanese standard. You get greeted enthusiastically when you enter and leave the restaurant. Servers are often very busy but remain prompt and friendly. If you come here during peak hours, you'll likely find yourseld waiting a bit for a table, but definitely a shorter wait than the Sansotei nearby. The only cons that caused me to take off a star is that the egg does not come with the ramen and has to be added on at an extra charge when the price for the ramen is already quite expensive. After tax and the 20% tip I usually give them, my bowl of ramen with no extra add ons or upgrades comes to around $16 which is definitely on the higher end compared to the other popular chains like sansotei and kinton. Overall, it is still my favourite ramen place because of how good the ramen is (which is an understatement). However I don't come here as frequently as I'd like to because of the price. On a side note, I really wish that Santouka can open up another shop or two in the GTA as they currently only have one location downtown. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I was really looking forward to trying it.When we got there on a Saturday afternoon, there was obviously a really long line of people. We were trying to figure out what to order and definitely wanted the pork taco, since it was the only meat offered other than their multitude of fish tacos. Unfortunately, once we got to the cashier...we were informed that they were out of a bunch of tacos. We ended up getting the baja and the mahi mahi tacos. We had to wait a little while, but that was to be expected considering the huge lineup of people waiting to order and pick up as well. The atmosphere was really nice and felt authentic.As for the tacos themselves, I don't think I can agree with the majority of the reviews here. I found them kind of bland even after putting some of their spices on top. I've been to a lot of taquerias, so maybe my expectations were a bit high. That being said, the ingredients were fresh and there were nice chunks of fish. Just a lack of flavour...If you want to have a great Kensington market experience, then sure stop by.

There's 2 doors to the suite, so it's really convenient...With this room, we were able to sleep of 4 girls &amp; 1 lucky guy... LOL... It's such a great place to crash when you party! &amp; get up the next day for shopping with your girls! A great place for tourists, &amp; for those who love to shop, this is a place to stay if you travels with a group. NOTE: Since it's right where all the action. Don't choose room with street views because you will not be able to sleep, unless you are a New Yorker :-)PROS: Location, service, &amp; the rate.CONS: the valet/garage is on the other building, so a long walk for you.The hotel is 3 STARS itself, so why 4 STARS for me = VALUE of the $ I paid!!! Definitely I got more compare to other hotels around the area. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I really enjoy the flavor of ginger, so I was really hoping that the ginger flavor would be prominent in this tea. The Pu'erh tea has a pleasant taste, but the ginger is not as strong as I would have liked. I recently tried theCardamom Pu'erh Tea Bags, 16-Counttea and I honestly like it better than the ginger version.Pu'erh tea is supposed to have some great health benefits (aids in digestion, weight management, and energy). I can't say that I've noticed a big difference in those areas, but if nothing else, it's an enjoyable cup of tea - just be aware that Pu'erh does have a rather distinct flavor compared to other teas.

      "Corresponding review: Delicious!I have tried so many granola bars, protein bars, breakfast bars and snack bars, that I was ready for these bars to have the same problems: too sweet, fake flavor or weird aftertaste.  But I was pleasantly surprised!  These fiber bars have a deep chocolate/coffee flavor, they are not overly sweet and have absolutely no strange aftertaste.  They have a nice texture, combining some crisp rice crunch with creamy smooth filling.  I would eat these bars instead of candy bars, because they taste much better and provide 9 grams of fiber.  They also contain no high fructose corn syrup and they are a more tasty alternative to Metamucil wafers, which often taste like flavored sawdust.Each bar is only 120 calories and is very low in fat, but you should be aware of the carbohydrate count, which is 25 grams.  However, if you count net carbs, then that number is reduced by 12 grams, to a very reasonable 13 grams per bar.  I would definitely buy this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: So we all know there is major hype with this book.  And like all curious minds, I caved figuring it had to be at least halfway good considering all the mad crazy eyed people singing its praise.  Unfortunately, about midway into the book I kept questioning if I was reading the same thing.  From all the craze, I expected great writing, engaging characters, an interesting plot, and namely all the ingredients for a good novel. What I received in reality was a subpar erotic romance with one dimensional characters, and an iffy plot.Fifty Shades of Grey starts with the main character, Anastasia, or Ana as she likes to be called, who is on the cusp of graduating college.  She's a clumsy, nave, young female, who never wears makeup, tries to hide in a crowd, and doesn't see her own beauty.  And, because she is so utterly sweet, is cajoled into interviewing Christian Grey, a mega rich, surprisingly young man with a million dollar company, for her best friend's school paper.  From that moment forward, it seems Christian just can't keep his eyes off little Miss Ana, and manipulates a few non-chanced meetings. Things seem to get hot and heavy between them, but Christian tends to frighten Ana, especially with his needs and intense nature.  As an adopted orphan, he went through his own living hell, and has the emotional and physical issues to prove it. But Ana is slowly losing her heart to him, and can only hope that she has the stamina and strength needed to not only help Christian, but to see if he can learn to care for her as well.**Slight Spoilers**With the synopsis, such as it is, out of the way, let me start by saying I still don't understand the hype.  If people are reading this for the erotica alone, then I pity them as there are tons of authors who actually know how to write to keep a reader engaged, and the love scenes are way hotter.  If you don't believe me, just check Amazons kindle section in fiction. They have enough variations in erotica for all kinks of life.  Now if you are going into this for the romance/plot...I still hold by my \"there are way better authors out there\" mentality. The plot isn't new or unique by any standard, and the writing was subpar at best.  It all boils down to Christian having major issues from being abused as a child, and because of this he uses BDSM as a form of management for his internal struggle.  It's like he has to have control over everything as an adult as he couldn't control anything as a child.  (think Sleeping with the Enemy without the husband being totally psychotic)  Ana is totally innocent in all things sexual, and Christians kink causes such a big shock that she doesn't know whether she likes it or not.  So nearly the whole book is a revolving \"yes, no, yes, no\" with her.  And speaking of the characters: I found that Christian had more personality than Ana, and that's saying something as this is told in first person from Ana's point of view.  Christian is definitely an alpha male (which I do love alpha males), but his personal demons cause him to be slightly cruel in my opinion. Ana is a complete spindly individual who was written so nave that it held me in shock.  She doesn't understand some of the innuendo or \"devices\" Christian wants to use that even if you aren't in the world of BDSM you've at least heard of.  If I could, I would give this book two and a half stars, as it wasn't horrible, but it could've been written a lot better.  It did cause me to want to know what happens at the end, so I'll give it that, but all in all Fifty Shades of Grey just didn't do it for me, and I feel slightly duped for giving in to my curiosity.

      "Corresponding review: This book was a first in many ways for me. It was my first book in the steampunk genre, which seems to have become all the rage. It was my first zombie and my first modern horror novel. And it was the first YA book I've read since being a YA myself.I hadn't been avoiding any of these--on the contrary: seeing review after review by my Goodreads friends has had me adding book after book that I would not normally have read or sought out. One of the reasons I'm making a point of telling you all this though is because unlike many readers who will read this review and/or the book itself, I don't have much to compare it to--frankly, I have nothing to compare it to! But here goes ...===SUMMARY===Dearly, Departedis set in 2195 and centers around the people of New Victoria and the Punks. While they share ancestors, the two groups have been in a war with one another for generations, though at this point it's not all-out and amounts to border skirmishes, as well as propaganda-driven ignorance and misinformation about one another.Nora Dearly, a young woman in New Victoria, is still mourning the loss of her father a year ago. She's home from boarding school and is greeted by the distressing news that her aunt has wasted away their fortune and one of them will have to marry advantageously to refill the family coffers. All of this gets shoved to the back of her mind though, when Nora's life takes a dramatic turn.Home alone one night, she is attacked by a group of flesh-eating, decomposing, and mindless zombies. Trying to fight them off, she is saved just in time by a team of soldiers--also zombies, but turns out they are the good guys.What follows is one revelation and danger after another. She learns that being \"dead\" doesn't mean what she thought it did, befriends zombies, and falls into requited love with one of them, Bram. All around her, various existential battles are being fought: Punks versus New Victorians, the living versus the dead, the good guys versus the bad ones.===REACTION===Overall, I enjoyed the book and found the middle portion very engaging. The beginning and end were fine while I was reading them, but easy to lose interest in between reads. There were several funny lines and great exchanges. I loved most all the characters and found Nora to be a surprisingly likable heroine (I have problems with a lot of the PNR ones); she also showed no signs of having been lobotomized, but instead acknowledged risks while also not freaking out at every little thing. I loved the secondary characters: they were very funny, the back-and-forth between them was entertaining, and they were well-defined; by the end, I liked some of them as much as I did the main onesThe author tries to pack a lot into one book and that was the book's main failure in my mind. There are too many storylines being explored and too many different factions, which was a shame because on their own I found most all of them interesting. The final section feels extremely rushed and includes a huge and non-subtle information dump explaining everything.One of the things that took a little getting used to was that the story is told in first person ... from five different people's POVs. By far, Nora and Bram get the most narration time, but we also spend significant time with the other three characters. At least the transitions were clear though, with the narrating character's name at the beginning of every chapter. The switch was annoying when it would happen just as I was really getting into a POV. It wasn't a deal-breaker though and I enjoyed Bram's and Nora's.I have learned by now that many fantasy/paranormal romance readers have certain pet peeves, a certain type of ending being one of them (Chicagoland Vampires anyone?), so I want to include this warning: while there is not a dramatic cliffhanger like that, the ending and epilogue are most definitely a setup for the next book, with a few plotlines left dangling.===STEAMPUNK and ZOMBIES and YA, OH MY!===Despite the issues I had with the author biting off more than she could chew, I thought this was a good introduction to these genres. It definitely piqued my interest and makes me want to move these books higher in my TBR list. I found Habel's creation interesting and there's no doubt she has a good imagination--I loved the Punk vs. New Victorian aspect and wanted that to be further explored.While I haven't read steampunk or zombies before, I love the science fiction classics, so I am familiar with world-building and etc. Though I never felt like I was back in the \"regular\" world, I did think that the integration was not consistent and at times confusing. Some examples are how not all the zombies were really zombie-ish (right? not an expert here), the Victorian-ness at times felt forced, and I often completely forget about this supposedly huge and defining division between the two societies.===BOTTOM LINE===At the end of the day, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. Were there problems? Yes, most definitely. But the romance between Nora and Bram was sweet, the secondary characters were wonderful, and the novel has an interesting storyline ... well, several, which was one of the problems, but regardless: I did likeDearly, Departed. Though I will not be rushing out to buy the second book when it comes out, I am curious about what happens next in this world Habel has created.*Originally reviewed for Fiction Vixen Book Reviews.

      "Corresponding question: What menu do you want?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This place will always be a Meh in my book. I first tried it a few years ago and it wasn't a good dining experience. Our waiter was ignorant, moody, and borderline b*tchy (did I mention it was a MALE waiter?) The service was so bad that I can't even remember how the food tasted. This year, I decided to give it another chance after a couple of my girlfriends convinced me that it's a good dining place and it's one of their favorites. So I went back for the Winterlicious event with my boyfriend. I ordered the Lobster soup (obviously), Lobster Tail fettuccine, and the Belgian choco mousse cake for dessert because they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake I originally wanted (my dining experience started to decline at this point). The boyfriend ordered Grilled calamari stuffed w/ risotto, Rib eye steak, and tiramisu for dessert (they misspelled tiramisu as tiramusi on the menu, which was such a turn off). I also ordered their special cocktail for the event, called Cabana. It tasted like a fruit punch. WHERE'S THE VODKA?!?!?!?!1. Appetizers: I have to admit that their Lobster soup was yummy. It's the best part of my sub-par dining experience. My boyfriend's stuffed calamari was also good and the portion was quite generous. 2. Main entrees: My lobster tail was quite big and grilled to perfection. The only thing I disliked about my main was the fettuccine. I like my pasta well done and it was al dente. It's just my personal preference and it's definitely not their fault. My boyfriend asked for a medium rare rib eye and when it came, he thought it was more of a medium to medium-well. Anyways, it was still a good piece of steak. My only itch about his dish was the veggie side. They used bokchoy out of all the greens out there! Believe me, I love my bokchoy, but NOT with steaks. It's like pairing BBQ pork with arugula. How do you like that? 3. Desserts: I was still upset that they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake and didn't have a fruity-type dessert as a replacement. I couldn't really enjoy the chocolate mousse cake because my first two dishes were already very creamy. I swapped my dessert with my boyfriend's tiramusi (haha!) and I definitely preferred that over the mousse cake. In the end, we didn't finish our dessert because the overall dining experience was just... underwhelming.A couple of things worth mentioning:- Our waiter was nice, attentive, but not annoying.- I noticed that a couple of other tables had some issues with their main courses. The guy beside us didn't finish his steak (1/2 of it was still on the plate) and when the waitress asked whether or not he would like to pack up the rest, he said no. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. Another table complained about one of the steaks being tough (overcooked?) and asked if they could get a replacement. The waitress tried to defend herself by saying that the steak looked overcooked because of the dim lighting in the restaurant. WTH?!? The patron said it was tough! She didn't even say it looked overcooked, she already tasted it before she complained! Oh boy...Anyway, I wouldn't go back to this place.Well, maybe for the Lobster soup. MAYBE.That's all, folks! :) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: To be entirely up front here, I admit to purchasing a lot of movies on DVD and rarely having the time to review even a small percentage of them. However, every so often, a really good or really bad movie comes along truly worthy of the extra effort. This movie falls into the latter, really bad, category.Absolutely everything Tom Cruise does in this movie appears faked or contrived. When he acts like he's crying, it appears fake. When he is acts afraid, it appears fake. When he is acts angry, it appears fake. Based on his performance in this movie alone, one can only reasonably conclude this man just cannot act.At the same time, Spielberg seems utterly incapable of producing a believable movie. According to this Spielberg movie, the first thing one wants to do when the aliens show up in town is to literally fight to get aboard a slow moving, brightly lit, ferry boat with absolutely no means of escape. Utterly absurd. Since the premise is so unbelievable, I suspect they actually included this segment in the movie simply to have an opportunity to show a special effect sequence of a ferry sinking. Many other segments in the movie were just as unbelievable.While this movie is somewhat more true to HG Wells story than previous movies, it deviates from the book in several significant regards - including a disturbing murder by the lead character played by Tom Cruise. And, again bowing to nationalism like prior movies, the location was once again changed to the USA instead of London.There is very little about this movie I liked. The child playing Tom Cruise's daughter, looks and talks like a much older midget (with little demonstrated acting ability). The child playing Tom Cruise's son, looks like a vagrant or tramp (with an attitude problem). Neither of these children in the movie act like normal children their age, nor like children might act in this situation (how children do act in similar scary situations).Finally, based perhaps on the notion that nearly half the families in America end in divorce, it appears Spielberg (like so many other directors today) was simply compelled to feature a dysfunctional family in this movie instead of one more like the other half of the families in America. Just once, I would like to see a modern movie featuring a healthy family my own can identify with.If you're a Cruise or Spielberg fan, your standards are perhaps low enough for you to probably like this movie. However, if you're a science fiction or War of the Worlds fan, this movie will likely fall far short of your expectations. On the cover of the DVD, Gene Shalit (of Today) described this movie as \"Tom Cruise's finest performance,\" while Joel Seigel (of Good Morning America) described this as \"Steven Spielberg at his best.\" This movie may indeed be these two individual's finest and best, but it is still far from good.

      "Corresponding review: This is a difficult story to simply \"get into.\" I would agree with those of you who say once you stick with it that the story will start rolling eventually. However, the only reason I have finished this book, the girl who played with fire, and have began reading the girl who kicked the hornets nest is purely out of my undying stubbornness. You see, in my haste, I purchased all three books based on all of the rave reviews, which is obviously my main mistake. Despite the fact I have a hard time stomaching the majority of the material in these books, I have continued to read based solely the principle that I will not purchase a book I will not read -- I kept reading.Before you judge this book based on my review, please keep in mind that I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan, I love all of the Twilight books, and the Hunger Games trilogy. I am a sucker for sci-fi and an impossible love story, the kind that never happens in real life. I want to feel happy after reading a book, not have nightmares... Yes, the girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy has left mental images that I would have been happy to live the rest of my life without.On the other hand, I have realized that it is my own fault that it is difficult to face the realism in this book. Many situations in this book have a real life-like feeling to them, almost too real. I suppose this is one of the main reasons I hated reading these books. I always want to see the best in people and hate knowing how unbelievably horrible people can treat each other. I wish I could just live in my never-happening Nicholas Sparks love stories but the cold hard truth is people suffer.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo -- Very Real -- still hated it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Gabriel Merrick and his brothers have an affinity for the elements, and can do amazing things with them. Gabriel's gift lies with fire. Although sometimes it seems more like a curse as fire is very volatile and difficult to control, and that loss of control comes with serious consequences as he well knows due to the loss of his parents in one of his fires. Despite his immense guilt, Gabriel can't stay away from the fire no matter how hard he tries. This proves even more dangerous than normal when an arsonist starts setting deadly fires and Gabriel becomes the prime suspect. Even his own family thinks he's to blame, leaving him very isolated and alone. The only one who seems to believe him is a girl in his math class named Layne who he feels inexplicably drawn to, but she has her own secrets to keep. Gabriel will have to find a way to fight the fire raging inside him before he loses everything and everyone he has ever cared about.I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't Gabriel's biggest fan in the previous installment. He just seemed to be too quick to anger for my tastes. In all honesty, I felt he was a jerk. However, in Spark, I saw him in a whole new light. Sure, he still is quite the accomplished jerk, and rather nasty to people in general, however, now that I understand him a little better I realize it is all a front to hide his massive insecurities. His element is fire, making him very volatile and really a powder keg ready to explode at any given moment. However, he despises himself for the lack of control he has, further frustrating himself and only adding fuel to the fire. He honestly cannot be described as anything other than severely damaged. Every day is such a struggle for him with his guilt and his desire to change and learn the control that seems forever out of his grasp. To make matters worse, everyone around him seems to think the worst of him, but in their defense, he doesn't exactly make it easy for them to believe in him. However, the further the book went on, the more the tide seemed to change as inch by inch Gabriel started to gain ground, and I was only cheering him on the entire way.Layne is very damaged in her own way, but unlike Gabriel who puts out a very rough exterior, she hides deep within herself, trying to stay unnoticed at all costs. Yet, despite that she has an amazing inner strength of will that rivals Gabriel's even if she doesn't outwardly show it. It really amazed me just how similar they were deep down when you looked past the surface. Appearances definitely can be deceiving, and that definitely holds true here. I think it is that similarity in both strength and damage that really drew them to me as romantic interests. I just felt like they were on rather equal footing, an almost rarity in YA novels, making the romance very sweet and enjoyable. By having both of them damaged, but still incredibly strong, they were able to use their inner strengths to start to heal the other. I really do not think a more perfect match could have been made.As much as I loved Storm, I have to admit that I was a little hesitant to read Spark. I'm a very loyal person character-wise, and I pretty much drag my feet whenever there is a change in character focus as I get so attached to the original ones that I don't want to let go. However after reading Spark, and getting to know Gabriel and Layne, that natural hesitance I have may very well have to change. In all honesty, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually may care for them even more than I did for Chris and Becca. So much so, that I wish there would be more focus on them in the future books. But then again, if the series trend is any indication, I'll probably wind up having a new favorite couple by the time I finish the next book. That being said, with this latest installment,  Brigid Kemmerer has fully cemented herself as a heavy hitter in the Paranormal YA genre. Trust me, she will definitely be one to watch out for and I cannot wait to see what is in store next. I highly recommend Spark to anyone who loved Storm as it will definitely rock your socks off. And if you haven't check this fabulous series out yet, well what are you waiting for, trust me you won't regret it. An absolute must buy! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

They were modern but everything was falling apart. Soap dispensers were empty, hand dryer broken, floor was filthy... they definitely need to put in some sort of cleaning schedule with the staff.

Now I know I will be grabbing a jar that does have a coconut flavor for cooking, I imagine shrimp would be fabulous in coconut oil.I also make my own facial cream.

I love regular Fig Newtons, but stopped eating them when we started eating more whole grain and no/low sugar and over all healthier.  Also please know, I do not like crunchy cookies, I like soft cookies, period.  That said, I was surprised by how much I liked these.  They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the fig but not so much any honey, nothing wrong with that.  Over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  I think I prefer the flavor of the cranberry ones to these because the flavor of these is not as strong and is warmer flavor than the citrusy cranberry ones.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.  The first ingredient is enriched flour, but they do have some whole wheat flour and whole oats in them too, the are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and has fructose listed near the end.  We won't buy treats or sweetened cereal where a serving has more than 9 grams of sugar, and guess what?  These only have 7 grams of sugar per serving which is three cookies.  I will not at all feel bad letting my kids eat these cookies, especially since a serving for a preschooler would be one cookie.  I also like that they bag is re-sealable.  Now, while I said I preferred the cranberry flavor that preference is not enough to make but the cranberry ones over these and the reason is that the fig ones have one more gram of fiber and one less gram of carbs per serving, that little extra is enough that I'd choose the fig over the cranberry and why these got 5 stars instead of 4 like I gave the cranberry ones.

      "Corresponding review: I bought these to replace my i-Luv earbud headphones that only lasted a couple of months. Compared the iLuv product, this product fails to meet the mark. First off, no one company were selling all the different colours and I was forced to buy 2 pink ones from Amazon. While the packaging was aesthetically pleasing, it was a mother to open. Really, the packaging was EVIL! I also didn't expect the cord to be hot pink all the way through. I don't really like that. The sound quality is meh, especially when compared to the iLuv. I am not impressed at all. The only thing that could redeem this product is if it lasts about a year. We'll see how that goes, but I don't really have high expectations seeing as I've been disappointed by nearly everything thus far. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I love to have meal bars in my purse because they are great when I don't have time to stop and eat a snack (and might otherwise reach for fast food).  However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor.  These Pure bars address this completely.  Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients.  If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing.  The taste is also pretty decent.  Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat.  It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but i's definitely palatable and reminds me of a blueberry muffin.  If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar.  That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna).  Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands.  However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this.  I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job.

      "Corresponding review: Last night I watched the hidden version included in the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, and its always interesting watching the deleted scenes, and seeing what versions of the movie have what extra features. Now let me get this straight. According to the ultimate alternative ending, Judgement Day did not happen, as the future is not set, and John Connors went on to become a Congressman, instead of a leader of the resistance. So Sarah Connors spends half of her adult life smuggling guns, blowing things up, assasinating people, and being locked away in a psycho ward for telling people that machines from the future were sent to kill her and her son John. We won't even touch the millions of dollars worth of damage she caused to property. Yet, here she is 30 years later, walking around free as a bird. And even though these things she said would happen did not happen, she is still seen as a hero, and not a nutcase, and she runs around like a nutcase telling everyone that each day is a gift. A gift from whom? Since the future is not set, and assuming here that God has nothing to say about this, the gift must largely come from Sarah. Its just a moviem, and perhaps we don't really want to go in this direction. Maybe it was a good idea that this alternate ending was never used.This Ultimate Edition of the second Terminator movie is one of the three best movies I have for sound. I have a Pioneer Elite sound system with 5.1, B & W speakers, and a Panasonic HD TV. My system rocks. Therefore, when a new edition was offered with better sound and picture, I was interested. I can say that my setup can tell the difference between very good and very, very good. And as very good as the Ultimate Edition is, the Extreme Edition is even better. If someone wants to buy my Ultimate Edition dvd, I will be happy to sell it to them, and I will be more than happy to keep my Extreme edition. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the friend?\n",
      "Corresponding review: After hearing from a few blogger friends how hilarious and great this book was, I was really looking forward to listen to the audiobook of it. It was just as fun as I thought it would be, but also had a greater story than I imagined it would. Not only was it laugh out loud funny, but it was really sweet too. I really came to like the characters a lot. Not just Caroline and Simon, but all of them. I wanted to get to know all of them! But besides that, you would assume that this book is all about sex by the cover and synopsis, but it's really not. In fact, I was actually surprised by how little actual sex was in the book. Instead, it was a great story about getting to know each other and getting to know themselves along the way.Caroline was an incredibly fun character. She is successful, smart, has awesome friends, has a kickass cat, and is in general pretty happy with her life. One exception is her missing \"O\". That's right, she has lost her orgasm. Now in a new apartment, she finds out the first night that her neighbor has some pretty amazing sex. Proof being that his \"Wallbanging\" knocks a picture off her wall! Not only that, but his partners are all quite entertaining with their vocals. Caroline has a funny nickname for each of them! The best thing about Caroline was her inner dialogue. OMG she was so funny. She gets really irritated by Simon at first, but they finally make a truce and she finds that she likes spending time with him and getting to know him. I love that she was a very strong and independent woman, and she wasn't going to just fall at his feet like every other girl. If she was going to have him, she would be the only one.Simon was awesome!! He is charming, funny, sexy, and also has a broken side to him that he keeps hidden. It's in no way some super secret thing or anything, but it was really great to see him slowly figure out himself while trying to figure out Caroline. He was my favorite character I think. He was honest and up front about things, but he wasn't really into talking about personal things. He does eventually open up and I loved seeing him really let someone in. He was so different with Caroline than he seemed around everyone else. You could tell he really cared about her way before she could actually tell.The chemistry between them is great. You knew they were great for each other, but they both kept it strictly friends. It was so fun to see them go from pretty much hating each other, to tolerating each other, to a growing friendship and spending time together. Movie nights, cooking together, just hanging out. They fell into such a comfortable and routine companionship that it was so obvious that they were falling for each other, and only they couldn't see it. It was a nice change to have a slow build up since so many books are insta love now. Them getting to know each other made the story so great!!I listened to the audio and I have to say that the narrator was really great at putting the emotion into the book. She really brought Caroline to life. If she was angry, sad, happy, whatever, you knew. He doing the male voice was pretty good too. I find that it's a lot easier for male narrators to do a female voice, than a female trying to do a male voice so I tend to not be too bothered by that. The only bad thing about the narrator being so into the reading was the steamy scenes. She gets very into the moaning and groaning, and it made me feel a little awkward listening to it. It felt like I was intruding on something personal lol!! Luckily there aren't all that many scenes like that so there was a minimum to my blushing. The rest of the book was made better by how much the narrator really got into it though. I have put her on my list of awesome narrators.This book was a perfect mix of steamy and hilarious. I found myself literally laughing out loud at some points. (and getting some really weird looks). It was fun and entertaining and I didn't want to put it down. This book did really great in both the plot and character development. I found myself lost in the book and feeling like these were people I actually knew and hung out with! I cared about the outcome of their situations and I wanted them to be happy. I love when a book can really suck me in like that, and this one sure did! Bonus points also because we get a chapter from her cat which was super fun!!* A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for an honest review. I did not receive any compensation.

      "Corresponding review: I was sort of looking for a product like this and luckily for me, this one became available.The actual Taco Bell Restaurants used to have a taco salad that I liked and, unexplainably, they discontinued it -- but by incorporating the ingredients that they formerly used and by topping the salad with this dressing, it tastes much the same to me.Over and above that, if you're tired of the same old Italian or Ranch dressing on your green salad this will bump it up a notch. It's especially good if you include sliced boiled eggs in your salads. You can also use this dressing (a small amount) to infuse an entirely new flavor into your home-made coleslaw.Everyone in the household who tried this product liked it so you're not going to be stuck with something unwanted if you give it a try.Recommended.

      "Corresponding review: This was a disappointing experience. I read about Buca on Eater and it was also recommended by a friend's friend. The space itself is sleek and beautiful. But it's also loud, so much so that I could barely hear my dining companions unless they were shouting. The space could use some warmth. The food was okay. We liked the garlic knots and cheese plate as well as the pastas. The carbornara stood out. The pizza was bland and warm at best. Where Buca really falls apart is the service. Now it's possible it could be remedied if you were able to hear your server. But that would mean my server would have had to come to the table. Obviously she didn't. She dropped off the menus and took our water orders. She then spent a very very long time to return, at which point we placed our orders - not just drink but for everything. It would have been nice for her to return to take our drink orders and ask us if we have any questions. After our food delivered, she all but disappeared. Not once did she come by to ask if we wanted another drink as our cocktail glasses sat empty. We had to repeatedly flag down other waitresses and bussers to get water. I had told the restaurant that we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Though none of us placed a dessert order, I thought they'd still bring something small out as most other restaurants do. I guess I could live with some of these things but not at this price point. Go somewhere else. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I was curious to try this Blackberry Vanilla tea but didn't expect to like it that much. The unique tea bags are pyramid shaped which is unique. Each tea bag will easily brew 12 oz. of flavorful tea. To my surprise I actually like it. I like blackberry and vanilla but I couldn't imagine them together in tea. The blackberry is smooth and not overpowering and I really don't notice the vanilla flavor much if at all maybe just a slight hint.

      "Corresponding review: One of my favourite restaurants in the city! Everything about it is amazing...from the service to the food to the facilities and atmosphere. Guu is most certainly deserving of 5 stars.First off...the atmosphere/service: You're always greeted in Japanese upon entering by the lively employees. (If only I could understand what they say!) Seating has been quite quick here in my experiences but I can understand that at peak times it may not be like that. There are three different types of seating setups here...bar-style seating by the cooking area, communal-type tables and then another seating area where you remove your shoes in traditional Japanese-style and sit by a sunken table. I've never had the opportunity to sit in the latter area but it looks like fun! It is a very loud restaurant so not exactly the preferred location for a quiet get-to-know-you date. GREAT location for birthday parties, as they take pictures of your party and give you a chalkboard to scroll down the birthday girl/boy's name.The food...AMAZING! You can't go wrong with your choices. I've never been let down! The bibimbap is a favourite of mine as are the kimchi udon noodles. Beer is cheap here too! The Sapporo always helps give it a more Japanese feel :)The facilities...very clean! A coat hangar area is provided which is convenient but I'm always skeptical about leaving my belongings where I don't have a direct line of vision. I'm still scarred by a previous coat-stealing experience elsewhere one fateful night.  As for the washrooms downstairs...they are impeccably clean. Each stall has its own beautiful sink (I know, I focus on little things like that hahaa) and amenities including mouthwash and cups (nice touch!).An amazingly Guu'd experience is had here ;) Run to Guu!

      "Wrong annotation: available until the summer (i always believe that stuff should not be released until all the feature\n",
      "Corresponding question: Was it issue ?\n",
      "Corresponding review: UPDATE (26 June 2012):I got ready to add a USB storage device (Seagate 2TB) to the router and when I launched the router page I was presented with a new screen and asked to create an account for Cisco Connect Cloud.  I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!  Highly recommend!!! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Corresponding review: The Logitech G700 gaming mouse is by far one of the most desirable mice I have ever owned. I had upgraded from a 6 year old Logitech Performance Lazer mouse, which still works for the most part, but some of the buttons are hit and miss. A lot of the functionality and the like for the G700 have already been reviewed in the comments so I won't bore you with repeated like to like reviews. What I will be focusing on is it's battery life in fine detail.The Logitech G700 comes with a 1.2v AA 1,900 mAh eneloop brand rechargeable battery. It is rated, according to the manual and double checked by Logitech support team, that the mouse can function on a full charge with continual use between 8-10 hours of battery life. That's right ladies and gentlemen. A retailed value Logitech mouse of $99 will last you 8-10 hours on a full charge with its included battery. Ridiculous you say? Well you are spot on. One could easily spend $20 bucks on a cheap mouse on any brand and get 2-3 months of battery life. Sure it would not have the Logitech label on it, would not have the 13 programmable buttons and some other fancy stuff but bottom line you would not have to recharge the battery every day, or even every week with a mouse rated to run 2-3 months on a single battery. So lets just come to realization that the battery life on this mouse is extremely awful, probably the worst I have ever seen in the history of wireless mice. While talking to the Logitech support team they stated its comparable, the Logitech MX Performance mouse, lasts up to 30 days on a single charge. Why the HUGE difference in battery life? Well according to the Logitech support team both mice have the exact same rechargeable battery. So again I ask myself why does the G700 only last 8-10 hours on 1 full charge and the MX Performance lasts 30 days on one charge and they both contain the same battery? What is destroying the battery life on the G700? What drains it so quickly? The Logitech support team had no direct response and made the excuse that because the G700 has more buttons and it's a gaming mouse that it drains the battery faster and this answer was from an assistant manager after I got fed up with the international gentlemen who had to look up every question and was hard to understand. I call BS on that answer I really do. So I decided to go out and do some testing...I went out and purchased the Logitech MX Performance mouse so I could compare the two. I also decided to purchase a pack of eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh to see if truly this G700 really has an awful battery life or I just got a bad battery. In theory I should be able to get roughly 4 more hours of battery life with an extra 800 mAh if this battery truly only has a running battery time of 8-10 hours on a single charge using its stock battery giving me an estimated run time of 12-14 hours. After further testing the Logitech MX Revoltuoin triumphs the G700 in battery life by far using the eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh on both mice. So again the question remains why does the G700 chew and spit out battery life in a matter of hours VS the MX Revolution lasts a full month on a single charge? I did some research and found that gaming mice naturally have a higher polling rate (ping rate) and they just hog battery juice from their internals because they require more power for more precision and less lag time. Plus gaming mice are for the most part are wired, not wireless and there are reasons for that because of the power gaming mice require to function at their best. What does this gibberish polling rate mean? Basically speaking its how many times your G700 talks to your computer. For example if your polling rate is set to 1000Hz then your G700 is updated every 1 millisecond. That means your G700 and your computer talk 1000 times per second. That's a lot of talking which means a heavy load on your battery. However if you change it to the lowest setting for the G700 which is 125Hz then your G700 only updates every 8 milliseconds which is 125 times per second which is a lot less talking which means less battery consumption. What does this all mean to the average user? Well if your not a hardcore gamer where every millisecond counts on your life then your in luck and should be able to get up to a couple days of battery life on a single charge depending on your average usage. Please note the below instructions are for getting the longest battery life out of your G700 and may not be up to snuff with your gaming needs. Here is how to do it...1. When your G700 is NOT in use toggle the On/Off switch underneath it to \"OFF.\" This way your G700 is not always trying to ping your computer even if it is not being used.2. Install the Logitech Gaming Software for your G700 from the Logitech website and set some settings. Set the polling rate to 125Hz. This is the best setting for using less battery juice. Also set the \"Advanced\" settings to \"Power Save\" which will put your mouse to sleep quicker when idle resulting in less consumption of battery juice in case you forgot to toggle your On/Off switch.3. Get a better mAh battery. Logitech threw in a common 1,900 mAh battery which is normal but stupid on their part since the gaming mouse beats it's battery to a pulp. Go out and upgrade your battery to a 2,700 mAh battery. For those who don't know mAh is basically the capacity of your battery. In most cases the higher the mAh the more capacity on name brands minus some fine fine details. However If you go and buy a higher mAh with Chinese writing all over it on some shady website chances are it's a cheap imitation and like all cheap imitations they are...well cheap and expect them to work half as good or less than a name brand.Because of the below average support from the Logitech support team as well as the lesser capacity battery included where a higher capacity battery was obviously needed I took away 2 stars. I would of taken 3 stars off if I had paid the full retail price but I was able to price match Amazon.com at my local retail store and got it to a more reasonable and comfortable price. I hope my review educated you and most importantly helped you achieve greater battery life then you ever thought possible on your Logitech G700 Gaming Mouse. Thanks for reading! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the restaurant?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I just returned from two nights at the Villa Florence with my boyfriend. We had a wonderful time staying here. The location is superb-- right in Union Square. There are tons of shopping nearby and good restaurants. Our room was very comfortable. We had a down comforter and soft sheets. Aveda products in the bathroom were a nice extra touch. Although it is not a spacious hotel room, it was sufficient for two people travelling together. The lobby of the hotel is elegant. There is a bar and an upscale Italian restaurant.For the most part, staff was pleasant. One gentleman at the concierge didn't do a very good job of recommending restaurants for people on a budget, or assisting us make reservations, but he was an exception to the others who were mostly kind.We did hear sufficient noise outside our room from the street below in the early morning hours. I would have preferred an inside, courtyard room-- but those rooms were full when we checked in. I was a little disappointed that this could not by accomodated since I had called ahead one week to request a quiet room. I think there was some difficulty requesting this because I reserved this hotel through Priceline (but at $64 a night I wasn't going to complain!)Other nice amenities are the complimentary robes and a complimentary yoga basket to borrow during your stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to others! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: If you're looking for a hip place to have some amazing seafood and drinks with friends, this is the place. I went on Thursday where you can eat 100 oysters for $100. Every oyster was shucked to perfection and the servers kept the hot sauce and vinegar toppings coming. I also ordered the mahi mahi dish with coconut rice (amazing!). It melted in my mouth and was just the perfect amount of fish to rice, along with the savoury seasoned veggies (which were all cooked perfectly and not limp).I brought my 6 month old baby here and it was a by too loud for him but this is definitely not the type of restaurant that you should bring a baby to. The one thing I would suggest is for the servers to refill the water a bit more often. We put the water container on the outside part of the table, hoping a waiter would notice because they just kept whipping by (it was packed) but no one noticed until we eventually stopped someone. My parents had the calamari and loved it! I will definitely be coming back here again to try some more menu options (sans baby!) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How much fiber do you have?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The clear selling point of anything labeled \"back to nature\" is going to be its healthier ingredients and the crackers do a good job of stacking up against most popular brands in that area.  They have no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and no high fructose corn syrup--that alone puts them ahead of the usual in my book, especially the lack of HFCS which is so hard to avoid. They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).  So yes, they're certainly better for you.The question of course then goes to taste, a much more subjective aspect.  Personally, I found their taste slightly less rich, which is a negative, but better in two categories. They are noticeably less sweet which I prefer as I'm not a fan of sweet foods; obviously others may have a different view on that.  They are maybe a bit more dry, though it's hard to tell as graham crackers in general seem a bit dry to me.  But they are definitely crispier than the usual other types.We don't go in much for crackers in our house, but on the few occasions we'll do so, I'd certainly pick up these rather than the larger brands due to their healthier ingredients, less sweet taste, and similar overall taste.

Food was delicious, ceviche was fresh and chips were crispy and flavourful. We also had the baja tacos which had lived up to the hype. Service, on the other hand, was anything but exceptional. We weren't approached by our server until a little later (remember we were sitting outside), then proceeded to take our drink/food order. The food arrived sporadically (long waits in between). We had also waved down at least 3 different servers just for condiments. A meal that could've been enjoyed within an hour or less went on almost to two.

It tells of a family ( and a few friends) who livein constant danger in war- torn Germany.  There is an ever-prevent danger of being arrested for the slightest suspicionof disloyalty to Hitler and any of his doctrines.  No one can be trusted to keep a secret.  Into this comes a young girl witha love for books, a refugee who is Jewish and in hiding, and the girl's introduction into the dangers and heartaches ofgrowing up in a neighborhood that is rife with fear, death and suffering.  This story is suspenseful, touching, and informative. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I had gone to SF a month before this trip and noticed the great location of the Grand Hyatt. Only one block shy of Union Square and the Powell Street cable cars, I planned on booking with the Grand Hyatt for this weekend trip. The staff was very friendly (especially the doormen) and cheery. Although the room was a good size and the bathroom well-stocked, there were a few gliches.First of all, when we arrived, apparently the clean-up staff forgot to check the mini bar, as there were two Chinese food takeout containers in the drawers (obviously left over from the previous guest)...also there was a very distinct odor in the room which was a mix of the Chinese food and very strong body odor. I went to the front desk to complain and ask to get some air freshner and was assured it would be taken care of...I'd love to say is was, but most of the smell was masked by me opening the windows and spritzing my own perfume around when I returned hours later.The final glitch was the noise. We were placed on the 8th floor as the trip needed to be as economical as possible. Until about 1am, I was kept awake by the loud whistles used by the doormen in order to hail cabs. I'm sure had I been higher up this would not have been a problem, but it was a little annoying.Besides that, the Grand Hyatt was great. The beds were very comfortable and the soaps and shower products provided were lovely. However, nothing tops the excellent location of this hotel. It is central to all great parts of the city. Just keep in mind that knowing the areas surrounding are important as only a few blocks away is the Tenderloin district which most travelers should avoid. Enjoy your travels! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: When I buy hard drives, I buy them primarily based on their cost and speed. I don't care about any of their purported automatic backup programs and never bother installing them. For about $100 for 3TB, this is a good buy. USB 3.0 is plenty fast and even if your computer is older and has only USB 2.0, this drive will still work, albeit at a reduced speed.Seagate is a very reliable brand and have about 8 other drives in various capacities. None of them have given me any problems. The only times I've had hard drives issues was due to neglect and damage by me (snagging a USB cord and sending the drive crashing to the floor, for example).

I came on a Wednesday night and saw a big line up around 8 pm, and the hostess had to deny a lot of people, because they were fully booked! This was my first time coming here and I'm so happy with my experience. The atmosphere will blow your mind. I love the interior design and how they used lights to decorate this place. There's good music, but it's not too loud. There are high tables, and for bigger crowds there are regular height seats. The shrimp tacos were so delicious. I never thought Mexican food would taste this good. We also had a chicken dish with couscous and sweet potatoes, which was my favourite! I was not too impressed with the steak though. The bill came out to $100 for two guests (we ordered 2 drinks and 3 dishes, as we were hungry)The majority of tables around us had ordered the Guacamole salad, Churos and Margaritas.

      "Corresponding review: Don't get me wrong, I love my e-ink kindle to death. It's served me well these past few years, but getting a Kindle Fire HD has opened up a bigger world of applications.For one thing, I can stream both Netflix and Pandora, which helps me on my personal and professional side projects quite a bit (I co-host several podcasts and radio shows based on entertainment like movies, books, and television).For another, I can finally take advantage of the electronic delivery of graphic novels, I feature I really love now that I've upgraded. The interface takes a few tries to get used to, as I'm a newbie to touchscreen interfaces, but it's pretty intuitive.It's also nice to have access to all of those casual gaming apps that most folks get on their smartphones. While Angry Birds has a somewhat limited appeal to me (I only got the Star Wars version), I'm really addicted to the Perry the Platypus game and look forward to trying out the Plants vs. Zombies port (I have the PC version and want to try out the tablet one).Now, I do have a few complaints, but none of them are big enough to drop it down from 5 stars.First, sometimes the typing interface and autocorrect can be glitchy. I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire... I just recommend to anyone considering it that they research both the wifi and the 4G options before purchase to see which option appeals to them more. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.

      "Corresponding review: The airbendar case is an excellent accessory for the ipad. I am using it with an ipad 2. I purchased it after I was happy with two other iPad keyboard purchases. The Airbender is lime having three accessories in one. First it functions as a keyboard, second as a case; and third as a stand. The nearly unlimited amount of positions the keyboard/case can be configured is awesome. The entire Keyboard can be separated from the iPad half of the case which is perfect for users that desire a little more distance between the two. The iPad can be used independent of the keyboard while still retaining half the case to protect the bottom and sides. It uses a pinch lock mechanism to quickly unsnap it. Other keyboard case solution areMuch more tedious. The keyboard has worked flawlessly since purchase. It was extremely easy to pair with the iPad. Feedback on the keys is excellent. Much better than those keyboards with the soft rubbery feel. The keyboard is also larger then most iPad keyboard which makes using it much, much easier for people like me with large hands. I charged the case once and 8 days later and its still working off the initial charge. I have no doubt that it will stay charged for weeks or months. Another great feature is the Airbender functions as a stand and can be configured in portrait mode for typing documents or landscape mode for games and movies. The case also shuts off the iPad when closed with the magnetic switch. The case looks great open or closed. I brought it to work and had several people asking me about it and where I got it. It has a very cool functional design. The iPad is held securely in place and all ports and switches are easy accessible. I highly recommend this keyboard/case combination. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I came here on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend and one of my closest friends to celebrate my birthday after having been wanting to try this place for a while. I thought that the place looked very pretty and I really liked the ambiance, but my overall experience in there was just so so. The server was nice, but she wasn't too great with the little details, such as refilling our water. On top of that, my boyfriend and my friend told me that they had to ask her twice to write Happy Birthday onto the dessert that we ordered (and had to order more desserts for her to get the second chance to write that for them) because she forgot to do so the first time.  On top of that, they take a fairly long time to prepare the food, even though we made sure to order our paella first because it usually takes a while.The three of us shared a few appetizers: croquetas de manchego, datiles con tocino iberico, and the patatas braves con huevos fritos. They were not bad, but definitely nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the patatas braves con huevos fritos too much, was hard and bland in my opinion. The paella patria was dry and a bit too salty for us, and all of us felt that the mussels tasted questionable - a bit too fishy in general. For dessert, we ordered flores con miel and the fried milk with the saffron ice cream, which was just meh, but the flores con miel was so delicious that we just had to order another one. That dish definitely saved our experience, I will go back again just to get that.In the end, our meal costed about $45 a person, and I can think of many other places I can go to with that budget, that have much tastier food than Patria.

      "Corresponding review: School's current average rating of 3.5 stars is spot-on. The atmosphere here is cool, unique, and playful - way better than any school environment I've ever been in. The theme runs well throughout the restaurant with drinks and syrups served in beakers, fake grass padding some of the picnic tables in their patio area, a wall of clocks (like those you'd see in a typical school), chandeliers with papers hovering near the lights, shelves with books and pieces near the bar, and an envelope with your bill - your individual progress report served at the end. At the time my friend and I went, she ordered a Brunch Bowl ($18.00) and I ordered the good ol' classic insta-worthy Black & Blue flapjacks ($16.00). The brunch bowl was plated and served nicely with tortilla slivers and a sunny-side up egg on top of the main goods. It was an overall delicious dish that made my friend full (and we entered with empty stomachs) however it was missing something to make it an amazing one. The flapjacks are oh-so-good and are stacked high. They're fluffy too which I prefer and are served with a side of brown sugar butter, vanilla whip cream, and Ontario maple syrup. These are definitely recommended for those with a sweet tooth and a love of pancakes - both of which I have. School is a must-try - it's especially nice checking out during patio season because the patio area is well-shaded with umbrellas and some sections lining the walls come with comfy pillows. Service is relatively quick considering the amount of people that were there and the food aesthetic is beautiful. School gives you better treatment that you'd find in any school and the food is beyond cafeteria-quality. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: One of the best young adult books I&#8217;ve read in a long time.  This is the story of a romance between two best friends Ella and Micha.  These two have known each other forever.  Both Ella and Micha come from broken homes.  Micha was raised by him mom after his father ran out on them; Ella&#8217;s mom was bipolar and her father is an alcoholic.  After Ella&#8217;s mom died, Ella suffers a large amount of guilt. One night after the death of her mom, Ella tries to jump off a bridge and Micha talks her down, they share a passionate kiss which scares Ella and she leaves town.  Unbeknownst to Micha, Ella is in Las Vegas enrolled in college.It&#8217;s been 8 months since Ella has been in Stargrove and now that she&#8217;s returned home for the summer break, she&#8217;s changed.  The bad ass Ella has now been replaced by what Micha refers to as the Stepford wife Ella.  It&#8217;s been 8 months and Micha has done nothing but look for Ella in all that time. Ella has no idea what her leaving without a trace has done to Micha.  Ella is only thinking that she is going to ruin Micha.Ella allows all her pent up guilt to completely take over her.  She&#8217;s trying to take care of everyone and please everyone and has not thought about what she needs or wants.  Micha loves Ella fiercely and he&#8217;s determined that before Ella goes back to school, he will bring back the real Ella.  These two have so much baggage but there is so much love with them.  I think what I loved best was as much as Ella loved Micha she wanted to be healthy for him. She didn&#8217;t want to be a burden on Micha.Micha has his own issues but he loves Ella and he worries about her and is all about protecting Ella from anything that hurts her.  Micha is mature and grounded and he knows what and who he wants.I most definitely recommend this book. It&#8217;s emotionally gripping and so very realistic. The issues Ella and Micha have are issues that at least one in 5 people have at some point in their lives. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: As I said, where to start? My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days.Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need.Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a &quot;loss prevention officer&quot;! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude.The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it.I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either. Who knows, maybe in 7 yrs it'll be back to the charming city I got to know before. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I loved the first book so this was a little bit of a let down. It answered some questions from the first book and gave you a few conclusions to some of the story-line that was left hanging. Over all I struggled to re-engage with the characters. The repetition of Tris being immature, running off on tangents with horrifying ramifications and over all being annoying were frustrating. The love/hate relationship got old fast. A lot of filler and setting up for the next book. Had I known where the story was going I would have been satisfied stopping with the first book. I have already bought the third so I will read it but I don't have high expectations for a story that started out so well. I would consider stopping after the first book. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called \"honeybush,\" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.

      "Corresponding review: It was my first time to Pai Northern Thai Kitchen & let me tell you... I LOVE THIS PLACE. I arrived on a Sunny Sunday afternoon with a friend. It was a busy downtown afternoon, parking was difficult to find. Ended up paying $20 for parking at a private lot. It was a wonder Sunday to walk, I didn't mind paying the $20.Atmosphere: As you enter, you'll feel the restaurant's energy. The exposed brick, dim lighting, upbeat rock and roll music & energetic staff is the perfect mixture to create a drinking environment. In addition with great tasting food, I can understand why this place is rated top Thai food places in TorontoFood & Drinks:To start we ordered the Chicken Gai Satay. I've eaten at many places for Thai food, from Khao San Road, Thai House Cusine, Golden Thai Restaurant, Spice Thai Cafe, you get the picture. The flavor and moisture of the chicken was phenomenal. It came with a hott sauce and a vinaigrette, absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying this appetizer.For our mains, we ate the Khao Soi & Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. The Khao Soi was delicious to the last spoonful. A variety of flavors run through your mouth in every bite. Spices were perfect, noodles were fresh and the soup was mouth watering. Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was an instant classic, watch for your heat request, they can get real spicy real fast, I requested for the spice to be on the side. Again, fresh flavors, tender meat, absolutely delicious.Price:Our bill came up to almost $75 before tip. We also drank Singha Beers & has a couple of Sake Bombs! So much fun.Overall, just writing this review and thinking about their food makes me crave them even more. Take a look at some of the photos I posted, but I suggest go have a bite in your free time to really appreciate the taste. This will be my new go to Thai Food place when the cravings hit. Great job Pai, thank you for a great atmosphere, awesome energy and most of all delicious food! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We stayed here in October while attending the Hardly, Strictly, Bluegrass festival in Golden Gate Park. We were given a room on the 21st floor that had a large picture window facing east with nice views of the city and the Bay Bridge beyond. It was fleet week, and they had a large fireworks show over the bay that we could see from our window.As others have said, the rooms are somewhat small (but that is the norm for most hotels in the city) but they are well appointed. The bathroom was adequate but nothing special but there was good pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower.The rooms have plasma tvs and a Sony CD component system. However, there was no high def available and so all you could get from their satellite feed was the standard broadcast &quot;stretched&quot; to fill the Plasma screen. For most this would not be an issue because you don't stay at the Nikko to watch TV but our visit coincided with the Baseball Playoffs and I wanted to catch some of the games. It would have been great to have seen them in high def.Also, the stereo system is very nice but there is just a cheap speaker box above the Sony components which did not sound very good. There should be a speaker system built into the walls or ceiling to get the most out of the music.We didn't use the swimming pool or fitness center because they charged too much. That should be included at the room rates they charge. We also didn't eat in their restaurant but did have room service one night and found the quality and service excellent and not really overpriced at all.As others have commented, it's not necessary to pay extra for the buffet breakfast because there is a Starbucks downstairs and across the street is a fairly decent and reasonable coffee shop that serves breakfast.All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Nikko. It was convenient to the buses we needed to take out to GG Park and we were also able to spend several hours over at the new mall that has Bloomingdales and Nordstroms. In the basement there is an excellent market that has many hot food offerings that are reasonably priced and looked very good. There are also several inexpesive restaurants to choose from. We ate here one night since I had a cold and had no taste buds so I didn't want to waste my money at the fine restaurants nearby.The Nikko is in a great location right near Union Square and close to the best shopping and also the theater district. The surrounding neighborhood can be a litte seedy if you walk down the wrong streets but overall this area is far improved from what I remember it being in the '70s when I lived in San Francisco. They didn't call it the Tenderloin because there were good steak restaurants nearby. However, from our room, we could look down at Tad's Steak House which, as a starving student in the '60s, was one of the few restaurants I could afford. Next time, we will go check it out.

He said he liked the more upscale varieties too, but that sometimes nothing hit the spot like a cheap, light Stars and Stripes beer. His outlook is not one of snobbery, he just likes it if it tastes good and that of the people outlook may be why his Momofuku chain is doing so well: After massive success and accolades, he still is just the kid from the neighborhood in New York who wants a bowl of soup.Or a really fricken' tasty pork belly bun.Go!

      "Corresponding review: Torn from You begins immediately after that crazy cliffhanger from With You. I do recommend that you read With You first because I think it is important for you to understand the connection between Emily and Sculpt/Logan. You will find that their relationship is raw and intense.Emily&#8217;s is ripped from her simple life. She is thrust into a dark world that is dangerous, abusive and disgusting. She is at the mercy of evil men who want to train her and sell her as a sex slave. But when she thinks the man she has given her heart to is there to save her, she couldn&#8217;t be so wrong.When Emily realizes it was Sculpt who brought her to Mexico and he owns her, she is horrified. Everything that she had come to know has been torn apart. Emily&#8217;s heart is shattered and she has no other choice but to do what she has to in order to survive.Her days in captivity will test her strength and her ability to survive. The torture and torment that she goes through was heartbreaking to read. Logan owns Emily and she has to submit to him so that she is not sold to someone else. Raul who is the man in charge is evil to the core. He has agreed to allow Logan to have Emily but is watching them closely. Emily is torn between the hate she feels towards Logan and the guilt she feels for allowing herself to desire this man and continues to feel the raw and intense feelings she had when they first met. Ultimately, she does everything that Logan asks of her, although some is degrading and horrific, she has to survive and has no choice.As days slowly pass Emily continues to sink into her confusion with Logan. There are moments when she sees glimpses of the Logan she fell in love with but then it is quickly replaced with the cold and ruthless man who brought her into the darkness. She doesn&#8217;t know what to believe. He is protecting her from some evil things but why has he done this to her.&#8220;We were torn apart, because Eme &#8211; I&#8217;d never have stayed away from you any other way.&#8221;For me, the first part of this book was very dark and intense. I fell in love with Sculpt/Logan in With You then everything fell apart when I met him again in Torn from You. I felt the hate and anger that Emily did. But seeing bits and pieces of the old Logan gave me hope.The second part of the book took on a NA feel for me. I still loved it but it definitely shifted gears for me. It is 2 years later when we find Emily coping the best she can within the life she has rebuilt for herself. She has not had any contact with Logan and has no idea where he is. Her heart has mended a bit but she still carries around quite a bit of pain and anger from what she went through.Then one day Logan resurfaces again. Logan wants Emily back. He needs her back in his life. Emily is harboring quite a bit of anger and hatred. She is frightened of him. She hates that he reminds her of such a horrific part of her life. But Logan is willing to fight to get Emily back into his life. He needs her to understand why he did what he did and to let him help her heal.What we find out about Logan, his family and what he goes through is heartbreaking. But will what he tells Emily be enough? Is her heart strong enough to open up again and let him back in. We watch Emily struggle with her feelings but still stay strong. Logan is willing to do anything to get her back. Emotions are high and still very raw. We get some much needed answers but not without more crazy stuff.This was definitely a crazy ride for me. I loved Emily who was that girl who was beautiful on the inside and beautiful on the outside. She was a fighter and a survivor. She cared deeply. Sculpt/Logan was one of those characters that had me loving him one moment and hating him the next. He was intense and for me I thought he was emotional. He rarely loved and when he did he did it deeply.I also thought the other characters were great too. Some were a bit crazy like Georgia (who should probably lighten up on the drinking) but she was great. Deck was a badass and I loved him. Kat was an amazing friend and so was Matt. Crisis added a bit of craziness and Ream; I wonder what his story is.Looking forward to more things from this author! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This version of Jane Austen's fine novel, Pride and Prejudice, is really quite spectacular.  The casting is splendid.  The actress who plays Elizabeth Bennett's mother is absoultely hilarious.  Her grating manner and voice really add to the character.  Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy....SIGH....Well, thanks for allowing me that moment of digression.  Colin Firth plays a wonderfully proud but intriguing Mr. Darcy.  You find him snobbish in the beginning, but by the middle of the movie you are really rooting for him.As with all BBC productions, the sets and scenery are marvelous.WARNING:  The &quot;bonus&quot; featurette was a bit of a disappointment though.

Our experience was good, though with the odd poor spot.Some measure of the quality is indicated by the crispy sesame encrusted and lemon fragrant bread which comes to start.We had the crispy artichokes which were a real delight, warm with a sweet element and plenty of them. As our waiter recommended, we had the eggplant kibbeh - beautiful, soft, fragrant. The chanterelles flatbread was a complete disappointment - very salty, hardly tasting of chanterelles  and otherwise indifferent.The octopus were tender and good tasting but rather overpowered by a Piri Piri like sauce. The rack of lamb was cold, and certainly not worth the $42 pricetag. The cauliflower and brussels sprouts veggies were great and well worth trying even if they were a bit salty.Service was polished, professional, and informed.The wine list is comprehensive, we had a wonderful Sancerre for$90, followed by a Cote de Nuits ($125).

      "Corresponding review: This place has great food with excellent flavours! The only reason it wasn't a 5-star was because the service was quite terrible and could've brought the score down more if it wasn't for the food.Staff: We were informed by our server that it was a small plates style similar to Spanish tapas. Given that we were a party of five it made it an excellent chance for us to experience the dishes. However, we had tried to order the dishes based on the recommendation of a small for each of us (so five smalls), a rice dish, plus two larges. However each time we chose the dishes we were gently informed that the large dishes we chose were quite tiny so we should rethink our order and would walk away telling us to ponder with our own thoughts. This caused for confusion amongst us because we had changed it up 3 times before we had ordered enough food that the server felt was enough, which ended up being 4 smalls dishes, a rice dish, and 4 large dishes. I almost wish that they wouldn't have suggested otherwise in the first place and made us doubt ourselves multiple times. The food came at a reasonable pace, but everything always felt hindered by the service. At one point we asked for dessert menus and it took nearly 20 minutes and a second reminder before we got the menu. It seemed that they were well aware we wanted the menu but felt that they needed to (slowly!) clear the dishes before we're given the menu. This whole meal took 3 hours because of the service.Ambience: It is a nice clean environment with comfortable seating. The place is dimly lit which was okay but as the sun was setting, it definitely got dimmer. It definitely had a Mediterranean feel when it came to the restaurant and the plates and utensils. It was nice seeing them prepare some of our food and drinks, as some of the prep is visible to the diners. Overall, great setting!Food: To keep this from being longer than it already is, I'm just going to put in one line comments on each dish we ordered. Roasted Red Beets: nice yogurt, soft and juicy beets, excellent dish. Duck Kibbeh: I'm a huge fan now, with the great spices and flavours. Hamachi: I didn't care for it, but at least it tasted fresh. Lamb Ribs: a huge hit with everyone but I can't really comment since I didn't eat it. Chargrilled Cornish Hen: Excellent flavours, so juicy and causing my mouth to water just thinking about it again. Whole Boneless Branzino: It was okay, but nothing memorable to me in terms of flavour. Fried Chicken: I loved it, it was crispy and flavourful and reminded me of southern fried chicken. Yogurt Baked Fluke: I was most looking forward to this dish, but it relied heavily on the yogurt for flavour rather than the fluke. For dessert we had the Pavlova which I found was very tart for me, the Crispy Qatayef which had a strong floral aroma but tasty nonetheless, and the Loukoumades which was alright but the burnt honey ice cream was amazing!I don't know if it was our server, but it seems like other reviews had a much better service than me, so maybe I'll come back soon, especially for the food.

      "Corresponding question: Do you have any credit?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Although this first installment in the highly successful slasher series lacks what it is most famous for - serial killer Jason Vorhees - it is the best in the series. The infamous score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and scary and carries the film very well. The cast of basic unknowns adds to the sense of isolation that the makers of this film knew was a key element to making it as frightening as it is.Critics love to trash this movie but it must have done something right to spawn more sequels than any other.The plot probably needs no explanation but goes simply like this: Counselors setting up a camp in the middle of the woods are killed one by one in, each in a different grisly manner, but who is doing the killing?Many people take so many aspects of this film for granted because it has been ripped-off so many times (although, to be fair, it is somewhat a rip-off in itself of Halloween - using a holiday and a slasher killing teens). But this film introduced many elements into a genre it would actually almost invent by itself - the slasher film.First off all, we have the wooded setting, next we have a series of gruesome and creative killings (tamed by today's standards), using the camera to make you, the viewer, see the slaying of the victims through the eyes of the killer.The shock-ending of this film was probably the most effective of its kind in movie history and during its run at the theaters, you would inevitably hear a tremendous letout of screams right before the movie ended (I won't mention what this is just on the slight notion that someone doesn't know what I'm talking about). But the reason this scene succeeded so well was simple...because the film effectively created a genuiune feeling of terror and suspense for the first 85 minutes and took viewers by surprise.FRIDAY THE 13TH looks great in this digitally remastered widescreen DVD and helps to eliminate the dated look it was taking on due to increasingly poorer VHS releases. The only special features that this film does have are the trailer (which is not remastered but shows the great contrast between the remastered and unremastered prints) and chapter selection. Unfortunately this is not the un-cut version but for some reason does contain a few extra seconds of blood in one scene (the third killing in the film of Annie) and a few deleted scenes in another (the decapitation near the end of the movie) and also contains a few extra seconds of the sex scene. An uncut version or collector's edition has been cried out for amongst the many fans of FRIDAY THE 13TH but has been inexplicably ignored by its distributor, Paramount Pictures, who basically view this cash cow as a blemish on the face of their film catalog.

      "Corresponding review: Lately, I have been in a contemporary romantica rut.  It seemed as though a lot contemporary romance books (of late) had been following a similar story line, it was getting predictable.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Wanted is very much it's own story with fresh characters, plenty of heated scenes, and a storyline that drew me further into the book.Angelina is a woman with secrets and a past that kept her from being true to herself.  When her beloved Uncle Jahn dies, Angelina is left without her rock to lean on.  She struggles between her natural inclination to be a rebel, to live freely and her fear that letting loose will hurt those she loves.  I found it easy to identify with Angie, and she is a character that intrigued me from the first page.  Then there's Evan.  Evan has his own secrets and he pushes Angie away at first, for fear of drawing her into his dark world and a promise he had made to the late Uncle Jahn.  But, Angie and Evan have a sizzling chemistry between them that neither can resist.When I say that Evan has secrets and pushes Angelina away, it is because of secrets.  Evan does not have the deep-seeded emotional damage that some contemporary romance men have.  Evan is a man who developed his business to take care of his family by any means necessary.  Some of those means could mean big trouble for Evan, his business partners, and the people closest to him.  I really like that Evan is a different type of dangerous man.  He likes to be dominant and in charge, in life and in the bedroom, but not obsessively so.  He wants Angelina to make her own life choices, he does not make them for her or force her to his will.  Their relationship developed from a long period of friendship and closeness, so I believed their romance as a couple.Along with steamy romance and fresh characters, J. Kenner delivered a story of intrigue as well.  Evan and his business partners had drawn the attention of the FBI and there was a matter of stolen art that brought suspense and a bit of adventure to the book.  Overall, Wanted proved to be a very entertaining read.  I will definitely be reading  more of this series in the future, as I am curious to learn what Evan's business partners, his best friends, will be up to next.  I have read J. Kenner's other books before, her Stark trilogy, but, so far, I am enjoying this Most Wanted series more.  Contemporary romantica readers, I would recommend giving Wanted a try.*I received this book in exchange for an honest review* ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Canoe is another Toronto favorite and definitely one of the top restaurants in the city. I've come here for a date, a business dinner and with my family - it is that versatile. You can always rely on the service, food and the incredible view of the Toronto skyline / waterfront. TIP: If you're on a more casual date, grab seats at the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare the food - amazing experience.FOOD:- The raw bar is sublime and a specialty of the restaurant. If you can handle it, eat this.- ** the menu changes but there is usually a foie gras option and you should have it **- Have something truly Canadian as a main: Venison or Sturgeon for instance. There is usually something with maple also - do that!- Have a sweet Canadian wine with dessert (Inniskilin is a personal favorite) - and opt for one sweet and one cheese platter. You won't be disappointed.WINE: No words needed; this is one of the best wine lists around and you'll find what you want. Sommelier is also always helpful with choices and I'd leverage him/her if needed. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Out of all the tonkatsu places I've tried in toronto, this exceeded my expectations. Pricier than others, but they have a wide variety in sauces and meats. Most sauces are on the sweeter side.

The cheese was embedded between the layers of the batter and the meat.

      "Corresponding question: How is the movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: In what is one of the more anticipated Disney animated features since Tangled, the mousy studio has released its remarkable musical Frozen.  Starring Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars), Idina Menzel (Wicked, Glee), Jonathan Groff (Glee), and Josh Gad (The Book of Mormon Musical, Ice Age: Continental Drift), Disney's latest is fresh, bold, and unique in ways that should be applauded.Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, Frozen centers on two princesses, Elsa (Idina Menzel), the soon-to-be Queen, and Anna (Kristen Bell) of the fictional Norwegian kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa has the ability to create snow and ice, but suppressed these powers after a traumatic childhood incident involving Anna. After her cryokinetic powers got out of hand during her official July coronation, she goes into hiding, but her emotions trigger a magical, eternal winter that freezes the entire kingdom. The arrogant Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk) plots to turn everyone against &#34;the monster&#34; Elsa for his own devilish needs.Let's face it: the marketing for this film has been atrocious.  It has been cryptic to the point of turning folks off of the film.  The synopsis that I just provided above tells you much more than any trailer they've released.  This is too bad, because the film is delightful.Audiences are going to want to compare this to Tangled, which I think is fair, it being the last Disney musical in recent memory.  Tangled is a masterpiece that is a high bar to be up against, but I think Frozen is up to the task.  Therefore, the basis of this review will such a comparison.First off, the music in this true musical (there are 9 musical numbers compared to the 4 in Tangled) is fabulous!  They employed husband-and-wife songwriting team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez to write the songs, and they are fantastic.  I'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this, and it knocks the socks off of Tangled, in my opinion.The vocals are better than Tangled as well, with both Bell and Menzel being better singers than Mandy Moore.  And the amazing voice acting/singing doesn't stop at the leads: Groff and Gad are just as marvelous in their roles.This has been called a feminist film, which I think is true and not in a bad way.  It passes the arbitrary Bechdel test with flying colors, but doesn't try to punch you in the face with any overt feminist messages.  It's just a great movie about two sisters who are trying to navigate their way through the difficult circumstances that they were born to.Visually, the only thing better this year is Gravity.  The 3D is spectacular, although not essential.  The animation is flawless and stunning.Where Frozen falls short of Tangled is in its script.  The script just isn't as tight and the payoff and climax are not nearly as good.  Tangled's ending was so touching and caused me to tear up a bit, where this ending was just plain good and nothing more.  Although, the humor is probably a bit better in Frozen, if only by a hair.Besides a few script issues Frozen will be an instant classic, with its music and voices more than making up for its shortcomings.  I give it a 4.5/5 stars.  I can't recommend it enough! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Some people will like that it has a fairly high amount of caffeine considering its small size, but for me that's a non-issue. It has a mild coffee taste, but I would have preferred something deeper and richer. It also had a tingly sensation that I didn't case for -- almost like a really light carbonation. I'm guessing that's from the canning process.Taste is, of course, subjective. For me, the product had a decent taste, but didn't blow me away. I'm glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't order it.

      "Corresponding review: I'm just not impressed with coconut oil.  You can use it like other vegetable oils, but you have to work around its properties.I am impressed with the quality of Jarrow coconut oil.  The product I received was very fresh, contains no sediment or solids, and the packaging was very airtight.  I tasted it straight out of the jar, and it is flavorless.  It does not impart coconut or any other flavor to food.  It's simply a fat you can use like most others.  But coconut oil is expensive, regardless of brand.  I'd been considering buying some to try before it was offered in Vine, so I've seen prices.Coconut oil is solid at room temperature.  The label recommends refrigeration after opening.  Unless you plan ahead and remove it from the fridge well before you cook, you'll have to chisel it out.  It gets really hard when it's cold.  I didn't know this, so that makes me an uninformed (till now) consumer.  I've used it for baking and it's fine, really.  If you don't mind getting up at 5:00 am to remove it from the fridge and let it soften!I haven't tried doing this yet, but I think that when making a ganache that I want to set quickly, I could add a little coconut oil to my cream and chocolate.  Just a little bit should help it set up without affecting the flavor or texture.  Not too much, though.  It will turn the ganache into a candy shell, I'm sure.If you passionately love coconut oil, this will not disappoint.  If you're merely curious, well, there are other things to be curious about.

As a Birthday present, my friend took me to Canoe and it was everything we expected.Upon arrival, a host checked our coats before we were seated. The table gave us a great view of the CN Tower. Since it was after 8:00pm, we were really impressed with the city lights. For a Tuesday evening, Canoe was quite busy with 2 large tables of businessmen and several couples celebrating a romantic occasion. Service is above standard (you would expect it to be at those prices). An explanation of the menu was given, but we already knew that we wanted the Tasting Menu, which included:- Amuse Bouche (the prosciutto melted in my mouth)- Scallop Ceviche (refreshing and zesty)- Artichoke Soup (perfect cream texture)- Intermezzo (to cleanse the pallet)- Main course - I selected the Char (crispy and savoury seared top was amazing)- and a Dessert, Caramel Poached Niagara Pears (a bit sweet for my liking but satisfying).A wine from Ontario or Quebec was paired with each of the courses.Presentation of each course was beautiful, dainty and flowed kind of like scrolled penmanship! Even more impressive then the view was the timing of each course. Completed to perfection. Each time I set down my empty wine glass, a server was there to take it away, give us a slight pause/breather, and bring us the next glass before the next dish.I am a big fan of small plates and trying different items, which is probably why I loved the tasting menu. Not sure how often they change it but if my wallet allowed, I would return for the next version.We left Canoe feeling satisfied and in a blissful state! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: After whizzing through the entire My Blood Approves series in three days and loving every word, I wanted to fall in love with this series just as much.  It is the series from Hocking that gets the most comment, and the general concept is great.Positives first:1. The concept of what Wendy is, and how it is integrated into modern society complete with the concept of the changelings is great.2. Some of the minor characters (Wendy's brother Matt for example, and Tove have some unexpected depth, and I loved seeing glimpses of them)Negatives: (May be some minor spoilers in here)1. When Wendy's power (the main one) is introduced, I couldn't wait to see what she would do with it.  She was already able to use persuasion in her life before joining her family, so why, oh why wouldn't she use it when being attached at the Christening Ball thing? Or when Finn was being attacked and in danger? Or any other time she was in real trouble?  This thought echoed through my head at various times through the book, and interefered with my ability to suspend belief the way we all do when reading paranormals.2. Elora, in particular, didn't seem to have much basis to her character.  I got that she was cold towards people, but unless we truly understand mitive, and give her a human side/intuition/motive, I found her character a little hard to believe.3. Finn I wanted to love.  AS the main love interest in the book, I wanted to fall in love with him along with Wendy.  But his character seemed weak to me, and the whole concept of toeing the line because it was his job, didn't seem to me to be reason enough to keep them apart.But I'm interested enough to read the rest of the series.  Hopefully Wendy grows a bit more of a backbone, and some of the other elements I've mentioned will be better served over the next book.I'd give it 3.5 stars, but can only give three here, as it wasn't up to my four stars standard.

I am glad I did.The wait was a little longer than I am used to (compared to, say, Ginger), but I am a strong believer that good food takes time to create.I ordered their pork banh mi and my friend ordered the chicken banh mi. Both were absolutely delicious. The meats were seasoned as to not make the meat itself unrecognizable and I liked the fact that I am able to choose and moderate the sauces and toppings on the banh mi. Portion size is just enough to fill you (or me, anyway) without feeling bloated. Victory!I am hopeful that when they reopen after renovations they have not decided to increase their price points or portions. Nothing is more frustrating than a place that increases prices and decreases portions, banking on their clientele to not notice (cough-Gandhi's-cough). I would have rated the place with 5 stars, but having not tried other items on their menu and feeling a tad apprehensive about the forthcoming renovations, I will reserve the 'As good as it gets' rating for another day.

It's a thinking person's film, vividly told in a day to day fashion.This motion picture is literally poetic cinema in its truest form, although not entirely 100% accurate in the pure historical sense.Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher) is a stunning woman to behold who really does look very much like the real life character that she portrays, as depicted in old drawings.Shot in Virginia, the cinematography is magnificent.There's not a whole lot of dialogue between all the characters. It's voice over narrated as the story moves along. This is more art than movie. A bittersweet journey for the senses. An excursion that explores very harsh realities that are felt more than seen. Actually it's somewhat a chic flick in wolf's clothing.If you are willing to devote the time to let this story slowly unfold before your eyes, you will be enthralled.A superb movie for folks who are willing to be patient. Alas, most audiences aren't.Warning: If you're looking for action and adventure, you may want to look elsewhere.

      "Corresponding review: I wanted to read Hopeless because I love NA, and I have heard so many great reviews about it. So, when I saw it for free on amazon about a month ago, I knew that I had to get it, and my trip to NJ provided some time in my reading schedule that I could get to it.I was not disappointed. I loved Sky's character even though I was a bit confused by the opening. I was yearning to know what was going on and it took us back so that we could piece together what led her and Holder to that moment. Sky has some unique relationships all around and that kept things interesting. Her adoptive mom Karen is strict on no-technology and then very lenient in others, and I love the way they are together, just accepting but still Karen wanting the best for Sky. Sky and her best friend from next door have this friendship where they love and support each other even if they may not necessarily agree with the other's choices. Six, the above mentioned best friend, sleeps with a lot of guys and has gotten quite a negative name for herself, which makes me so infuriated--guys can do whatever and sleep or say they sleep with all kinds of girls and its okay, but women get judged and I think that its an important issue that they talk about.Holder is infuriating at times, and so sweet, thoughtful and considerate at others. Sky just doesn't blindly accept his mood swings though, she knows that he has a dark past and she knows part of it about his sister. They also share the bond of rumors about them both going around of which, not all of it or none of it is true. They feel this deep connection though and they talk about so much and try to always be honest with each other, but some things are hard to talk about and they cover that well.TRIGGER alert and Spoilerish paragraph. I also must give disclosure, I think that some of my readers also have suicide triggers, so be aware, it is in here. Someone sees it, and it is in another family and is talked about. I was effected more than usual because I wasn't expecting it. Nothing was gory but a character did witness and it was so similar to my dad's. For those with sexual abuse triggers, also present in this story.They have an undeniable chemistry and sexual tension between them, and I love every second of it. Knowing that Sky feels numb when kissing most boys, Holder really takes that aspect slowly. Especially kissing on the lips, kissing other places is def okay, and we see that he makes Sky feel things. Sexy things. Romantic things. Lustful things. But they never really get as explicit as most NA, so I think that makes a good transition if you've never read an NA before and used to just kisses or fade to black in YA.I really appreciate how they don't jump to saying I love you, and admit that they aren't there but still want to acknowledge that its deep and they haven't really felt that before.The more we learn about Holder though and see his actions at times, the more that I want to know about what he hasn't told yet.The secret that finally came out was def unique and shocking, but little clues and some of her dreams and the timing led me to believe something similar. I just couldn't piece together the details and man were they amazing and so well thought out. I can't imagine being in a similar situation for any of them or what I would have done.Bottom Line: Powerful and romantic NA. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.Highly Recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How do you like the story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: There's a wonderful, dreamy scene late in William Landay's courtroom thriller \"Defending Jacob,\" in which Andy Barber, his wife Laurie and their accused son Jacob are all lolling in the 14-year-old's bedroom musing about decamping as a family and sneaking off to faraway, exotic Buenos Aires to start a new life out of the spotlight and free of suspicion.Jacob asks, \"Is that true, Dad? Lots of beautiful women in Buenos Aires?\"\"That's what I hear.\"Laurie describes the South American city as a place of possibility where her son \"will have children, and his children will have children and he'll bring so much happiness to so many people that no one will ever believe that once upon a time in America people said horrible things about him.\"At this point in Jacob's first-degree murder trial it's evident to all three and to us that none of that is likely to happen, but still they can imagine and try to cope with an increasingly dark reality filled with dread and edging toward despair.Jacob has been charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of classmate Ben Rifkin, a bully. Jacob's father, an assistant DA until the indictment, is helping with his son's defense. He narrates the story, which is a suspenseful legal thriller that spirals into a harrowing story of family dissolution.Carefully plotted as any whodunit you've ever read, the theme takes on the same nature-versus-nurture argument as William March's provocative potboiler \"The Bad Seed.\" Unknown to Laurie, Andy is the son and grandson of violent murderers and the question becomes has Jacob too inherited a \"Murder\" gene, the \"Barber Curse?\" Suspicion becomes as corrosive as rust as family loyalty and love are tested beyond reasonable limits.A great deal of the enjoyment that comes from reading \"Defending Jacob\" is the pitch-perfect dialogue. Kids talk to each other and to adults just like the kids do in your house. When Andy articulates his life-long, adoring attachment to Laurie, the language is almost elegiac and in painful contrast to the harsh reality of their current relationship.Descriptions are vivid and memorable. Jacob, Landay says, has a way of keeping his answers short \"as if every word was a stick of dynamite.\" One soft-bodied character appears as if \"His sides, belly, and tits all sagged against his black polo shirt, as if he had been poured and bagged up inside this black sack cinched shut at the neck.\"\"Defending Jacob\" is in rare company as a courtroom drama that comes along very infrequently. Its most recent predecessor, to my mind, is \"Presumed Innocent.\" Both stories had a final twist that you think you're prepared for and still it comes out of nowhere. In a single short sentence and a few words everything changes. \"Defending Jacob\" is bold storytelling, compelling reading.[4.5 stars] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Do you find any impact of this book on your life ?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The early 1960s. The civil rights movement is well underway, with marches, boycotts and sit-ins. The resistance to change is no stronger than in Jackson Mississippi, where a black man can be beaten to within inches of his life for mistakenly using the white restroom. It is here that we meet the five main characters of the novel, three young white women who live on the privileged side of the bridge, and two negroes who during the day work as servants on the white side of the bridge, but at night return to their homes on the black side.Miss Eugenia (Skeeter) Phelan lives on her parents' cotton plantation and wants to be a writer, but her mother is eager for her to find a husband. Skeeter talks with respect to the servants, mainly because her family had a servant, Constantine, who raised her and who she loved. But Constantine left without any explanation while Skeeter was in her last months in College, and no one will tell her why or where to find her. Her best friends are: Miss Hilly - Head of the Ladies' League and from a well-to-do southern family. Her husband is running for state office, and she wants nothing to stand in his way, including any friends that might harbour secret integrationist views. Her pet project is to ensure that all white households build separate outside lavatories for their servants to use, so that `black diseases' are not passed on to her community. Miss Elizabeth Leefolt - a 23 year old mother who lives with her husband and child, whom she mostly ignores, in a small house. They are obviously poor, but Miss Leefolt tries to keep up with her wealthy friend Hilly, and takes on some of her attitudes, including the building of a lavatory in her garage for the servant.Aibileen Clark is a 53 year old black servant, whose 24 year old son died in an accident at work a few years earlier, planting a bitter seed in her. But she is used to keeping quiet about the indignities she suffers so as to just get on with her life, until...Minny Jackson is 36 and Aibileen's best friend, who is married to a man who beats her and has five young children. At the start of the story she is working for Miss Walters, Miss Hilly's mother, but Minny doesn't suffer fools, and has an incendiary, back-talking mouth on her, which leads to Miss Hilly dismissing her and putting the word out that Minny is a thief. This prevents Minny getting any work except for her secret job with Miss Celia Rae Foote, a simple, unsophisticated country gal, who married well above her station as far as Miss Hilly is concerned, especially as it was to her ex, Johnny Foote.The main plot centres around Skeeter's desire to be a writer. A New York agent likes her writing, but wants a more interesting story. The story that Skeeter latches onto is how the servants feel about their lives working for the white families of Jackson. This is incendiary stuff in a community resisting civil rights changes, and not only does it endanger Skeeter's friendships with Miss Hilly and Miss Leefolt, but at the very least it puts at risk the livelihoods, and potentially the lives, of the servants she interviews.But this isn't all serious highbrow fiction. I found many moments when I laughed out loud, particularly the scene when Skeeter's family have dinner with her new boyfriend Stuart's family, her mother eager to impress with pretentious chatter to snare a son-in-law.The book is written in the first person from the point of view of several of the characters, and the voices are all well realised.One of the insights provided by the writer was the fact that whilst the physical violence of this period may have been carried out by the men, how much the women could be involved in instigating it, especially if they felt they had been crossed. Hence Aibileen's thought as she contemplates the harm that can come to the family of those who participate in the interviews if they are found out: It'll be a knock on the door, late at night. It won't be the white lady at the door. She don't do that kind a thing herself. But while the nightmare's happening, the burning or the cutting or the beating, you realize something you known all your life: the white lady don't ever forget....Stockett's desire to entertain the reader sometimes overrides what a real character would do, such as when Skeeter pays Pascagoula's two brothers to do something that humiliates Hilly. Knowing the danger they would be in if caught, I cannot believe the real Skeeter would have done this.A couple of instances like the above aside, this was a great read, with interesting subplots about Skeeter's attempts to find a husband, her wanting to find out why the servant she adored, Constantine, left, the plight of Miss Celia Foote. But what will keep you reading is because you just so know that Miss Skeeter and the servants are going to be caught in their clandestine meetings - but the how and the what's going to happen to them is the mystery...If you enjoyed #TheHelp, you may also like Secrets From The Dust ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

They open at 11:30 for lunch on weekdays and I arrived around 11:40 and ended up being 2nd customer walking in for lunch. Restaurant is decent size with small tables for 2, 4 and larger tables for bigger groups- and there is also a bar area where you can dine by yourself.Ordered: Garlic Tofu (Tao Hoo Taud Samoon Prai) 4/5*Fried tofu breaded in a crispy garlic & fresh kaffir lime coating served w/ sweet & tangy garlic sauce for $8.00*11 pieces of semi-hard tofu almost looked like chicken nuggets*A lot of the reviews said it came super hot but it was just hot when I got mine*Usually I don't like tofu but this was bursting with flavor*Because they use semi-hard tofu, it feels like you are eating soft chicken nuggets*Big for an appetizer, it might be good to share between 3-4 people*These deep fried tofu don't even really need the sauce, it's already seasoned within the batter*Sauce is fresh and the sweetness balances out the strong garlic batter*Watch out for garlic breath after eating this (I swear your breath will smell like raw garlic after)*Not recommened if you are on a date!!Ordered: Pad Thai (Street Style) 5/5*Steet Style Pad Thai with broccoli with option of chicken/tofu for $10*Their lunch portions are quite generous*Broccoli pieces looked kind of random sitting on top of the Pad Thai*Chose tofu option for the Pad Thai*This had really good flavor, just sweet enough with spiciness that kicks in after*Notice how the Pad Thai (sauce) is not at all red*It didn't taste artificial or overly ketchupy like many express Thai places do it*This Pad Thai was probably closest to what I had back in Thailand, no doubt*I would go back for this dishOrdered: Khao Soi 3/5*Tender braised beef with egg noodles in a coconut milk enriched curry topped with crisp fried noodles for $10.00*This looked absolutely gorgeous on some of the photos I saw prior to visiting this place*I was looking forward to trying this because it's nothing like what I've tried in the past*Option of braised beef or chicken for this dish, I went with beef cause that's what everyone recommened*Curry is beautiful bright yellow color, very thick and rich and there is a lot of it*Noodles go very well with the coconut curry and the braised beef is very tender*Curry wasn't very hot when it came...not sure if it's suppose to be like that*The way they serve this dish, it makes me think that the curry is suppose to be like soup for this dish*Curry is too thick to be a soup for this dish which makes it quite difficult to eat cause you don't want the curry splattering everywhere*Half way through this, I realized this is somewhat like Islamic Noodles I had at Salad King (see here)*Now they serve Khao Soi at Salad King as well (but haven't tried it there)*I would personally prefer this dish to be served on a pasta plate with less sauce *Curry tasted a little too sweet half way through*I wouldn't recommened eating this if you have nice top on or anything white (or just really be careful)Ordered: Thai Iced Tea (Cha Nom Yen) 4/5*Thai spice and Black tea blended with condensensed milk served over crushed ice for $4.50*This somewhat reminds me of Vietnamese coffee (drip coffee with condensed milk served over ice)*Dark orange liquid in a huge glass filled with ice*This is almost like Chocolate milk without the chocolate but with the bitter tea aftertaste*Good to have with their food, to wash down all the spicinessI know many people compare Khao San Road to Salad King (check out my review here)- saying Khao San Road is authentic Thai and Salad King is somewhat westernized- which I do agree, it's true. Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food. Personally, I like both places- I def think Khao San Road makes better Pad Thai but if I wanted noodles in coconut curry, I would visit Salad King for Islamic Noodles. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: UPDATE (4/24/2013): This blu-ray disc does NOT contain a digital copy. It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.First, a disclaimer:I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).With that said, here are some of my thoughts:STORY/BOOK ADAPTATIONI'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.***END SPOILER ALERT***As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.CHARACTERS/ACTINGI generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the \"Took\" (adventurous) and \"Baggins\" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.SPECIAL EFFECTSGenerally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.OVERALLThe Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Corresponding review: Honestly, I've had this place bookmarked ever since it opened so I was pretty excited to finally try it today.After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I just about expected everything. So yes, I can testify to the comments about how the store is run by a friendly and cute little Asian couple. The lady on the till was very nice and personally came to our table (in the food court) to ask how we were enjoying the food. So overall service was pretty great.However, I found the food to be a bit disappointing. Having maintained such a high rating after so many months of running, I was anticipating a dish that would wow me. Despite the photos that would argue otherwise, I had hoped that the taste of the curry would trump it's presentation. My verdict: ehhhh..  I would give the food a 3.5/5. I had the chicken karaage curry ($9.61 tax included) and it was just alright. The chicken was moderately tender, not the melt in your mouth type, and the curry was a bit on the sweeter end. I've definitely had better karaage and the overall dish wasn't as hot as I had hoped it to be. Why I rounded down to a 3 star, however, is because of the rice. My greatest complaint would be that the rice was too soggy and had clumped together instead of standing alone as individual grains. I also would have appreciated more coleslaw as I felt the meal was lacking in vegetables.The other reason why I rounded down is because I am now insanely thirsty. I haven't been able to stop drinking water since this meal and now my lips have this mild burning sensation. Owing to the deep fried nature of the karaage along with the MSG in the curry, I probably should've seen this coming. Regardless, this is definitely not a pleasant feeling. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "review: This book has elicited in me mixed emotions. The story is certainly original. I admit I bought it for the vaguely sci-fi assumption from which it begins to discover that it was more like a romance novel with a literary fiction ending.The way it is written, mixing past, present and future, the narrative technique of the double point of view and the perfectly intertwined mechanism of time travels is definitely remarkable. As well the ability of Niffenegger's prose deserves praise as to capture the reader and make them empathize with the story. She could really make me live the story of Clare and Henry, but especially that of Henry, much more interesting than his wife.Bad, though, for the unnecessarily downhill final part, characterized by a continuous basking in the pain of the male protagonist. I found it sadistic towards the character itself and the readers. From the moment I knew how it would end, around page 300 (but I had a suspicion long before), I almost had no reason to go on. I continued to hope for a twist, because it seemed absurd that in a novel like that the ending would be so obvious so far in advance. But I was disappointed. The last scene is really disturbing. I read in an interview that Niffenegger has written that scene at very first, which is even more disappointing.What can I say? It certainly enriched me in many aspects of the way in which it was written, but I do not know if it was worth reading, given the prolonged bad mood that got me in the end. I want to enjoy myself when I read, not bring myself down.What a pity.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",
