      "Corresponding question: How is movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: It's funny how people react to this movie. Some call it &quot;flat,&quot; others say it &quot;lacks edginess,&quot; and others say it &quot;doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie.&quot; Of course, people are entitled to think whatever they want; I just feel that they're judging The Phantom Menace based on 16 years of their own expectations rather than judging it for what it is: a visually stunning space-fantasy popcorn flick. The battle scenes outdo anything in the original trilogy! I'll grant that it doesn't have the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies, but that's because it _is_ the underlying heavy mythology of the original movies. The plot is kind of convoluted, but you should be able to make sense of everything if you pay close attention. If not, just enjoy the visuals.The DVD itself is outstanding. The picture and sound are perfect and there are plenty of extras, including an hour-long documentary focusing on the making of the movie. Rick McCallum is hilarious. My favorite extra is the first web featurette, showing George Lucas going to work on his first day of writing the script (November 1, 1994). The deleted scenes are great also.This is one of the most loaded DVDs on the market, so give it a shot. It may be impossible, but try to watch without prejudice! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I was going to buy another case for 100 dollars at BB, but found this one on Amazon, and I am so happy I bought this one.One thing I do wish it had was magnets on the two bottom resting metals that hold the ipad when it is standing in landscape or portrait, cause if you accidentally tilt the ipad to much backwards, then the ipad has no locking mechanism to stay put and may fall backwards. This is really not a deal breaker for me cause i already know its like that so Im just more careful. Only problem maybe when someone that doesnt know about it, may pickup my ipad and not realize it and it may fall backwards. So a magnetic strong enough force to keep it standing would be an awesome upgrade.Overall, I am so happy. Many walk by and say, hey that is a nice little Pc, then I tell them its an ipad. they say WOW, that is so awesome. Case looks really professional and protects the Ipad big time!I recommend anyone to buy it! especially at this great price! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Communal seating in the middle of the restaurant can be charming and annoying at the same time.A thing I do notice here is that service tends to be slow.

The place was jam packed and their was a decent wait, but luckily I was able to snag a seat the bar. The rest is history.With old school r&b playing in the background, I ordered some fried spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai. While I was waiting I chatted it up with a bartender who gave me the low down on the restaurant as well as the area and where to go. After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place.

      "Corresponding review: My favourite ramen place so far over sansotei, kinton, kenzo, etc. It is located in a relatively quiet street behind yonge dundas square and eaton centre so it may be a bit hard to find at first. Every time I come here I keep thinking that its the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. I often change up what ramen I get but the consistency of the delicious rich and flavourful broth and the firm yet chewy noodles. Seriously, its so good. Service there is always fantastic, definitely up to Japanese standard. You get greeted enthusiastically when you enter and leave the restaurant. Servers are often very busy but remain prompt and friendly. If you come here during peak hours, you'll likely find yourseld waiting a bit for a table, but definitely a shorter wait than the Sansotei nearby. The only cons that caused me to take off a star is that the egg does not come with the ramen and has to be added on at an extra charge when the price for the ramen is already quite expensive. After tax and the 20% tip I usually give them, my bowl of ramen with no extra add ons or upgrades comes to around $16 which is definitely on the higher end compared to the other popular chains like sansotei and kinton. Overall, it is still my favourite ramen place because of how good the ramen is (which is an understatement). However I don't come here as frequently as I'd like to because of the price. On a side note, I really wish that Santouka can open up another shop or two in the GTA as they currently only have one location downtown. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

What can I say to express the profound artistic void that this film represents? That the acting is wooden and hammy? That the story is about as interesting as watching bread mold? That the script is amateurish and insipid? That the film looks as if it were shot in a teenager's basement and backyard? That the special effects are, in effect, anything but special? That the only thing worth looking at in this entire film is Taylor Lautner's bare torso? I shudder to think that the final installment of this series will be divided into two films.

      "Corresponding review: Like many others that have written reviews here I grew up in the South in the 60s. I went to all white schools all my life and graduated from a 100% segregated high school and then went to the University of Texas in Austin that had very few blacks. In fact, UT won the National Championship of college football in 1969 with an all white squad. Impossible to do today. At that time we simply had very little day to day contacts with any blacks. It was not until I was drafted into the Army in 1969 that I had to actually work with blacks and get to know them one to one.This book ran true to my memories of the South. It really made me think and I enjoy books that do that. True, some of the characters are wooden and the men are not treated that well, but all in all it is the south I remember and it is the south that we need to leave behind. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The direction by Ang Lee is flawless in almost every frame.I was angered by the film for not giving a clear explaination for one of the character's death. I now feel differently. It is best for the viewer to think what they want about it. It was the death itself and how it affected the other characters that was important in the film. The death itself will affect the viewer, and Del Mar's reaction to it is heartbreaking.Some reviews mention the makeup, cloths and other superficial aspects of the film. They are not important to enjoying the film.The acting, direction and story are why the film should be seen and even studied.A student will find writing a thesis on the story, the film or book a great challenge. There are things in the film, subtle things, that get missed during one viewing. If you want to know what I am talking about, see the film again. Look closly at every scene; take it all in. I have not yet read the book.Brokeback Mountain is a wonderfully sad and disturbing film. It may have it's amusing moments, they are few. This film is about love, lust and life.

      "Corresponding review: The Lost City of Z is a non-fiction book by David Grann. It tells the story of British explorer Percy Fawcett.Percy Fawcett disappeared in the 1920's with his son and his son's friend while looking for an ancient city in the Amazon, a city that he had named Z. For decades, explorers then went in search for Fawcett in the hopes of finding either him or what had happened to him, often without much luck (often disappearing themselves). Grann, a journalist who never did ANYTHING in the outdoors (and took the elevator up two flights to his apartment instead of walking it) decided to go in search of Fawcett himself AND he was able to reveal new evidence how Fawcett died and whether he had really found his city or not.I found this book to be alternatively captivating and then quite boring. There were parts that were absolutely fascinating. I found the parts about Fawcett's early life and the author's life and motivations to be really, interesting. Oftentimes, the parts about the various explorations that Fawcett went on before his latest and greatest were boring. They were all the same and they all ran into each other. There was nothing to distinguish them and I found my attention lagging at those parts. I would have to put the book down and then come back to it later on. The book itself was very well written and very well researched. I was very impressed about the depth of information that was presented - Grann went all out.I walked away generally liking the book, in spite of its slow points. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Delicious!I have tried so many granola bars, protein bars, breakfast bars and snack bars, that I was ready for these bars to have the same problems: too sweet, fake flavor or weird aftertaste.  But I was pleasantly surprised!  These fiber bars have a deep chocolate/coffee flavor, they are not overly sweet and have absolutely no strange aftertaste.  They have a nice texture, combining some crisp rice crunch with creamy smooth filling.  I would eat these bars instead of candy bars, because they taste much better and provide 9 grams of fiber.  They also contain no high fructose corn syrup and they are a more tasty alternative to Metamucil wafers, which often taste like flavored sawdust.Each bar is only 120 calories and is very low in fat, but you should be aware of the carbohydrate count, which is 25 grams.  However, if you count net carbs, then that number is reduced by 12 grams, to a very reasonable 13 grams per bar.  I would definitely buy this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: So we all know there is major hype with this book.  And like all curious minds, I caved figuring it had to be at least halfway good considering all the mad crazy eyed people singing its praise.  Unfortunately, about midway into the book I kept questioning if I was reading the same thing.  From all the craze, I expected great writing, engaging characters, an interesting plot, and namely all the ingredients for a good novel. What I received in reality was a subpar erotic romance with one dimensional characters, and an iffy plot.Fifty Shades of Grey starts with the main character, Anastasia, or Ana as she likes to be called, who is on the cusp of graduating college.  She's a clumsy, nave, young female, who never wears makeup, tries to hide in a crowd, and doesn't see her own beauty.  And, because she is so utterly sweet, is cajoled into interviewing Christian Grey, a mega rich, surprisingly young man with a million dollar company, for her best friend's school paper.  From that moment forward, it seems Christian just can't keep his eyes off little Miss Ana, and manipulates a few non-chanced meetings. Things seem to get hot and heavy between them, but Christian tends to frighten Ana, especially with his needs and intense nature.  As an adopted orphan, he went through his own living hell, and has the emotional and physical issues to prove it. But Ana is slowly losing her heart to him, and can only hope that she has the stamina and strength needed to not only help Christian, but to see if he can learn to care for her as well.**Slight Spoilers**With the synopsis, such as it is, out of the way, let me start by saying I still don't understand the hype.  If people are reading this for the erotica alone, then I pity them as there are tons of authors who actually know how to write to keep a reader engaged, and the love scenes are way hotter.  If you don't believe me, just check Amazons kindle section in fiction. They have enough variations in erotica for all kinks of life.  Now if you are going into this for the romance/plot...I still hold by my \"there are way better authors out there\" mentality. The plot isn't new or unique by any standard, and the writing was subpar at best.  It all boils down to Christian having major issues from being abused as a child, and because of this he uses BDSM as a form of management for his internal struggle.  It's like he has to have control over everything as an adult as he couldn't control anything as a child.  (think Sleeping with the Enemy without the husband being totally psychotic)  Ana is totally innocent in all things sexual, and Christians kink causes such a big shock that she doesn't know whether she likes it or not.  So nearly the whole book is a revolving \"yes, no, yes, no\" with her.  And speaking of the characters: I found that Christian had more personality than Ana, and that's saying something as this is told in first person from Ana's point of view.  Christian is definitely an alpha male (which I do love alpha males), but his personal demons cause him to be slightly cruel in my opinion. Ana is a complete spindly individual who was written so nave that it held me in shock.  She doesn't understand some of the innuendo or \"devices\" Christian wants to use that even if you aren't in the world of BDSM you've at least heard of.  If I could, I would give this book two and a half stars, as it wasn't horrible, but it could've been written a lot better.  It did cause me to want to know what happens at the end, so I'll give it that, but all in all Fifty Shades of Grey just didn't do it for me, and I feel slightly duped for giving in to my curiosity.

      "Corresponding review: This book was a first in many ways for me. It was my first book in the steampunk genre, which seems to have become all the rage. It was my first zombie and my first modern horror novel. And it was the first YA book I've read since being a YA myself.I hadn't been avoiding any of these--on the contrary: seeing review after review by my Goodreads friends has had me adding book after book that I would not normally have read or sought out. One of the reasons I'm making a point of telling you all this though is because unlike many readers who will read this review and/or the book itself, I don't have much to compare it to--frankly, I have nothing to compare it to! But here goes ...===SUMMARY===Dearly, Departedis set in 2195 and centers around the people of New Victoria and the Punks. While they share ancestors, the two groups have been in a war with one another for generations, though at this point it's not all-out and amounts to border skirmishes, as well as propaganda-driven ignorance and misinformation about one another.Nora Dearly, a young woman in New Victoria, is still mourning the loss of her father a year ago. She's home from boarding school and is greeted by the distressing news that her aunt has wasted away their fortune and one of them will have to marry advantageously to refill the family coffers. All of this gets shoved to the back of her mind though, when Nora's life takes a dramatic turn.Home alone one night, she is attacked by a group of flesh-eating, decomposing, and mindless zombies. Trying to fight them off, she is saved just in time by a team of soldiers--also zombies, but turns out they are the good guys.What follows is one revelation and danger after another. She learns that being \"dead\" doesn't mean what she thought it did, befriends zombies, and falls into requited love with one of them, Bram. All around her, various existential battles are being fought: Punks versus New Victorians, the living versus the dead, the good guys versus the bad ones.===REACTION===Overall, I enjoyed the book and found the middle portion very engaging. The beginning and end were fine while I was reading them, but easy to lose interest in between reads. There were several funny lines and great exchanges. I loved most all the characters and found Nora to be a surprisingly likable heroine (I have problems with a lot of the PNR ones); she also showed no signs of having been lobotomized, but instead acknowledged risks while also not freaking out at every little thing. I loved the secondary characters: they were very funny, the back-and-forth between them was entertaining, and they were well-defined; by the end, I liked some of them as much as I did the main onesThe author tries to pack a lot into one book and that was the book's main failure in my mind. There are too many storylines being explored and too many different factions, which was a shame because on their own I found most all of them interesting. The final section feels extremely rushed and includes a huge and non-subtle information dump explaining everything.One of the things that took a little getting used to was that the story is told in first person ... from five different people's POVs. By far, Nora and Bram get the most narration time, but we also spend significant time with the other three characters. At least the transitions were clear though, with the narrating character's name at the beginning of every chapter. The switch was annoying when it would happen just as I was really getting into a POV. It wasn't a deal-breaker though and I enjoyed Bram's and Nora's.I have learned by now that many fantasy/paranormal romance readers have certain pet peeves, a certain type of ending being one of them (Chicagoland Vampires anyone?), so I want to include this warning: while there is not a dramatic cliffhanger like that, the ending and epilogue are most definitely a setup for the next book, with a few plotlines left dangling.===STEAMPUNK and ZOMBIES and YA, OH MY!===Despite the issues I had with the author biting off more than she could chew, I thought this was a good introduction to these genres. It definitely piqued my interest and makes me want to move these books higher in my TBR list. I found Habel's creation interesting and there's no doubt she has a good imagination--I loved the Punk vs. New Victorian aspect and wanted that to be further explored.While I haven't read steampunk or zombies before, I love the science fiction classics, so I am familiar with world-building and etc. Though I never felt like I was back in the \"regular\" world, I did think that the integration was not consistent and at times confusing. Some examples are how not all the zombies were really zombie-ish (right? not an expert here), the Victorian-ness at times felt forced, and I often completely forget about this supposedly huge and defining division between the two societies.===BOTTOM LINE===At the end of the day, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. Were there problems? Yes, most definitely. But the romance between Nora and Bram was sweet, the secondary characters were wonderful, and the novel has an interesting storyline ... well, several, which was one of the problems, but regardless: I did likeDearly, Departed. Though I will not be rushing out to buy the second book when it comes out, I am curious about what happens next in this world Habel has created.*Originally reviewed for Fiction Vixen Book Reviews.

      "Corresponding review: I've had it around 3 months. I went to adjust the sound. It wouldn't work. Than I pushed really hard and the sound button imploded. I've had Apple Nano 2nd generation for over 2 years never a problem. I only bought this because I was bored. Price is cheap but if they only last 3 months the value is low.I'll try to warranty it but they'll probably blame on misuse.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++With a little threatening, they replaced it. So we'll give them credit for standing behind the warranty.  I have it sitting around because I just don't like the short battery life. My 4 year old Nano 2 goes for 12-15 hours compared to the 6-7 hours of this unit and I got tired of it always running out of batteries on me.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I'm very satisfied with this unit with one exception. I only get approximately 7 hours of listening time. This is leaving the unit on at a fairly high volume and doing nothing more than listening to books. I subtracted 2 stars because battery life is important to me and I've already run out a few times.I'm using it for Audible exclusively. I had a Ipod Nano 2nd generation and prefer the Sandisk Clip+ unit. This review is for Audible Users, others probably won't be interested in it. I was looking through the reviews and couldn't find a review that would describe the interaction of this unit with Audible Useage.1. Very small and compact- The unit is really tiny. All I want to do is listen to books. The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger.2. Great Sound-This unit sounds as good or better than my Ipod.3. Simple Navigation buttons-Took less than 5 minutes to learn.4. On off button which I use as Pause too. It is well located to the top directly over where the headset plugs in, I can find it by feel and don't need to see it. So it is convenient to find an use. When you turn off the book while running it comes back on at the same point still running. The time to turn on and start playing the book is less than 5 seconds. I've found that this feature is key to my enjoyment of using the unit with Audible. No fumbling through the other buttons to find pause.5. Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. No cumbersome hard to find slide mechanisms. Where this unit blows away the Ipod units is that there is no touch sensitive wheel. Everything is push button. Without that sensitive wheel, I've never had to lock the unit. I had an Ipod which used the wheel which is sensitive so I always had to lock it. Big pain in the neck.7.Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. I prefer this to the ipod system.8. It organizes each book into it's own separate folder so it's an extra click but your books are organized together9. When part 1 of a book ends it automatically go to the next part.But won't open a new book. This is advantageous because if you fall asleep with Audible running than it runs to the end of the part of the book you are on, than the next part (if you aren't on the last part) and than it goes to sleep. This can reduce battery drain.IE listen before going to bed.10. Uses the standard Mini USB connector (the one that's bigger) so you can charge and Sync with the standard one used on many devices. I just bought 2Technocel MV9MCDUO-SP OEM Sprint Dual USB Port Car Charger - Blackalong with 2Dual Micro USB / Mini USB Splitter Cable - Charge up two Devices (One Micro and One Mini USB) Once From a Single USB Port - Ideal for mp3 players, Digital Cameras, Smartphones (Android, BlackBerry, HTC, Samsung), GPS, and More. This gives me 2 micro USB and 1 Mini USB in my Autos. With 1 of the Micro USB being rapid charge. I love devices with standard Micro USB connection. By the way I have aDMMR: Dual mini USB and Micro USB to USB Sync and Charge Cable (Retractable)at my office and it charged and transferred data flawlessly with this unit.I have a mini usb connection at home that I use for my Card Reader also transferred data and charged it.  Hurray. It's standard Micro USB.12. Fast Forward and Rewind are as good if not better than the Ipod and convenient. Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. This is advantageous because it allows for both slight f forward/Reverse and extreme f forward/reverse14.Expandable Memory using Micro SDHC. It was just so inexpensive I bought a 8gb MicroSDHC on Amazon for $6.00+ delivered8GB Sandisk MicroSDHC Memory Cardthis one is class 4 don't buy the class 2 might be too slow. With how cheap memory is it's better to buy the 4gb unit and upgrade instead of the 8gb unit. 4 gb does hold alot of books.15. Convenient Eject system from computer- I kept looking for the eject on my Windows Machine to disconnect. Finally I went to the manual. Turns out that as long as you aren't synchronizing you just pull the Unit out with no damage. Very convenient.15. You can listen to it while it's charging.The glitches:1. Battery life. Audible Playback only at fairly high volume using headphones. I only got around 7 hours. my Ipod Nano gets 14 hours. I had to take 2 stars off because that would be a deal breaker for many.2. For Audible can only use the Audible Manager.Remember Audible books are DRM Protected so you need the Audible Manager to decrypt and put on the Clip+3. Their is no way to organize the order of the books. It goes in Alphabetical Order (If I'm wrong please tell me how to do it in comments.4. Itunes tried to take over so I had to remove ITunes but I think that there is a setting or way that I could disableItunes from turning on automatically. Also my original default was through Itunes. Just be aware there may be issues withItunes and Audible Manager on your machine. Probably you can get around it.5. The books are grouped by Books. So if you are in part 1 of a book it'll play part 2 but won't go to the next book.Since it doesnt' go automatically. You have to stop and fiddle with it. This could be inconvenient for example if you are driving. Unfortunately once the book is organized on the machine their is no way to change the order. I have some books where it decided to put the Part 2 at the top and part 1 below. I tried accessing the drive in MTP mode which turns it into a hard drive. In Mtp Mode it showed as in order. So there was no way to fix a problem that doesn't exist when accessing the unit as a hard drive. To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button&lt;Settings&lt;System Settings&lt;USB Mode&lt; For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode.6. I'd prefer that it used a Micro USB connector which is used on most newer phones.7. Controls are very small. I have to hold it in front of me to use all the buttons except the on off and volume button.8. When Fast rewinding or forward my Ipod used to allow me to hear the words so it was easier to find the spot. This is totally silent.9. If I turn unit off and than back on sometimes it will resume at the beginning of the chapter that I was on. But I had the same problem with my IPOD. So I don't believe it's a Clip+ specific problem.If you like this review please rate it as helpful. When I was deciding whether to purchase this unit, I had trouble finding anything about the compatibility with Audible ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I have to admit that I loved the taste, but I suppose that's easy when it's got *double* the calories of the other 'flakes and dry berries' cereals.  The difference with this being that it's whole grain and sweetened with 'cane sugar' instead of corn syrup.  Also, the box is smaller than most cereal boxes.  This is only 10.5oz, whereas most are 16oz.  The sugar and carb count was very high with this cereal, so if you're trying to lose weight or have those types of concerns, I would avoid this.If you don't care about nutrition and only taste, than you'll like this cereal.  The flakes stayed crunchy even after being in the milk for a good while.  However, I suspect anyone who cares about things like preservative-free cereal, is probably a bit of a health nut and doesn't want to consume so much sugar.  But, the average consumer who simply sees a box made out of recycled cardboard with the word 'natural' all over it, will probably fall for the marketing and stay for the taste.I cannot recommend this cereal in good conscience.

      "Corresponding review: This is unlike the concentrates that I've ever tried. I like the taste and ease to use. It has concentrated sugar that adds a real nice flavor. As you can tell in the ingredients listed on the product page it has vitamin C listed third, behind water and critic acid. Also a natural form of caffiene, B3 and B6. These provide a pick me up to me after consuming a couple of 8 oz glasses with ice. The bottle is enough to last me about a month, when drinking about 8 oz a day on average. it comes in handy when I run out of soda or don't want a cup of coffee. The amount of natural caffiene is low and does not give me a nervous or jittery type feeling. I use a little less than the suggested amount because of my taste due to the fact that I prefer less sweet drinks.The price is good, and the Subscribe and Save brings it down another five percent. The bottle fits easy into my hand and the cap is sturdy enough to hold upside down and shake without spilling a drop. I would recommend this product as a semi energy drink or a replacement for Kool-aid, as it does have some valuable vitamins. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is this story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The Book Thief (2013) was directed by Brian Percival and stars Sophie Nelisse, Goeffrey Rush and Emily Watson.It's 1938 in Nazi Germany and young Liesel (Nelisse) encounters one tragedy after another. Her brother dies, her mother must put her up for adoption, her foster mother (Watson) is terribly cruel, and her classmates call her \"dummkopf\" because she cannot read. But Liesel's a fighter. With the help of her kindly foster father (Rush), she learns to read. A young neighbor boy (Nico Liersch) admires Liesel's spunk and the two become fast friends. But Liesel's growing love of books and reading puts her at risk in an increasingly authoritative Germany. When her family gives refuge to a Jew, Max (Ben Schnetzer), he encourages Liesel to think about becoming a writer.The events of the war lead to catastrophe but Liesel ultimately finds redemption in her writing.I enjoyed this tear jerker very much. The story and cast are simply superb. The only element of the film I object to is the part of the urbane Grim Reaper narrator who judges souls according to their goodness. But who is good?  God's Word says none are righteous.\"There is none righteous, not even one.\" Romans 3:10\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" Romans 3:23Yes, death and judgement certainly come to us all but God's Word says those who have faith in Jesus Christ will be saved.\"For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Romans 6:23\"For there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\" 1 Timothy 2:5\"Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" Romans 10:13The notion of a mythological grim reaper who collects souls and weighs and judges them according to the good and evil they have done is quite popular but is contrary to New Testament Christianity. Jesus came to save sinners, not the self-righteous (Luke 5:32). Just sayin'. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The leather strap is a nice touch and it fits so nice once you adjust it. This makes it so much easier to hold your ipad. This would be perfect for someone who has to walk around while doing stuff on the job. Perfect when you're trying to look at plans or lists while carrying out tasks. It's near impossible to drop this thing. You can also rotate the strap so you don't have to twist your wrist off to view it in a different orientation. The one thing though I had so much trouble opening the kickstand due to the fact that I didn't realize the angle I had to pull to open it. Also the case is rather unattractive if you don't account the leather strap. It just seems weird to have a nice strap and then have an ugly exterior. I give this a 4 out of 5. Durable and secure.

      "Corresponding question: How is the quality of the cast?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I am outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more. Outstanding soundtrack.. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: My daughter and I stayed at the San Francisco Westin on Market Street for two nights on July 24, 25, 2007. We totally enjoyed our stay. The room was immaculate and the 2 queen beds were sooo comfortable. We happen to get a pretty good rate because by the time we got there the rates jumped sky high. The view of the city was outstanding. Having never been to San Francisco before, we found ourselves in an excellent location within walking distance. The restaurant inside the hotel was excellent though very pricey as most things are in SF. We ordered room service and it was out of this world expensive (for a small pizza and two waters and one dessert it came to a whopping $59.00!). We walked and walked around the city. The conciere (sp?) was very helpful in where to go to eat and ordered us a car when we left on the 26th. We were going to try the mall's food court which was very nice but the power kept going out so we ended up at a small restaurant named John's - stay away from that one - overpriced and gross food. Then we went to an excellent place a day later named Two which was outstanding food. Do not visit SF if you are on a tight budget. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: I thoroughly enjoyed reading about America\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the read?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This ARC was provided by Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Publish date: April 24th, 2012 Juvenile Fiction: Love & Romance, 336 pagesHarper TeenFirst love can be a beautiful thing; that's why ithurts so much to let go. America Singer is a Five,just like her family. Neither are they on the verybottom of the caste-system nor one of theprivileged. Life is a struggle. Her mother hashigh hopes for America, and is delighted that shegot picked to take part in 'The Selection'. PrinceMaxon has come off age. He's ready to claim abride, the future princess of Ill&eacute;a. Competingagainst over thirty other young women is not whatAmerica wants. Then again, how can she disappointthe people she loves; keep them from a betterlife? Getting to know the supposedly arrogantMaxon for who he really is - anything but - onlymakes it harder.Finally, thank you - a dystopian young adult novel that pretty much catered to my every whim. I'm aware of the Goodreads drama surrounding this release, but to be honest, I don't care. The blurb captured my interested and I'm so thankful I was provided with a review copy. That's what it should be about. The book, the story itself! It's such a fabulous one, too. I think you should expect to be entertained and thus not think about every little detail too hard. This book is fun and it has a fresh take on the dystopia genre. I loved the modern elements! It made it easier to relate to the characters and what was happening to them.The writing was smooth and very teen-ish in an adequate way. Considering the heroines age, that most definitely is to be taken as a compliment. I liked America's voice. What I loved about the character? She was not bitter about being born a Five, instead, made the best out of her circumstances. It's truly awesome to see her smile, take joy in simple pleasantries. On the other hand, America was also a typical teenager wanting to break free of her confines. A lot of readers wrote about the heroine being stupid. I disagree. Being a teenager or a young woman for that matter entails (or excuses if you want) a certain degree of confusion. Everyone is entitled to make mistakes and be unreasonable. I didn't like her any less just because I found her actions questionable (at times).High praise for the author: The world building was flawless. She included important information in such a way that it never, not even once, interrupted the development of the storyline. Same as with the heroine, several readers complained about the lack of world building. 'It's not dystopian!', they say. Yup, you guessed right - I disagree. We have a mix between contemporary / modern and historical elements. Political structures? Check! The castes, the monarchy' The 'nightmare' world? Check! The huge gap between the privileged (One, Two, Three), the less fortunate (Four, Five, Six) and the unfortunate (Seven, Eight)- I categorized them for you. Is something automatically without depth when it isn't overly complex? No, at least not in my humble opinion. The modern feel to it? Check! You'll notice that right away. No need to explain.The secondary characters, even though the family didn't have a lot of screen page time, coaxed a smile out of me more often than not. Lovely family! America is a daddy's girl. Just like me. Her father was a gentle soul; a wise man. My biggest pre-reading concern was the introduction of the other candidates. I wondered how the author would pull it off. How many? All thirty-four of them? She did a wonderful job by focusing on a couple while the rest floated in the background - present, but not overwhelmingly so.Aspen versus Maxon: No spoilers, no spoilers, no spoilers *chantstoself*. It's a rare occurrence to fall in love (nah, okay, more like a crush) with both male characters. Of course I had a preference, but I'd have been okay with either outcome. However, I was desperate to learn America's final decision. Both Aspen and Maxon had responsibilities; a weight on their shoulders that sometimes felt too heavy to handle. They were proud, too - America stubborn. What an intriguing combination. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about America's life, learning about the Selection and so on before Maxon came into the picture. That Maxon-less time was well spent and necessary.America profited from this experience. It took her a while, but she suddenly saw the Selection process from Maxon's perspective. It wasn't easy for him either. Trust has to be earned and the author took this sentiment to heart. No insta-love, no insta-trust. You cannot imagine how relieved I was.Why not rate the book 5 stars then? The ending was too abrupt. Sorry to say that I didn't like it. It felt cut off rather than 'to be continued'. The author failed to hit the right key. I wanted to almost burst with excitement, not think 'The end? Well, okay then - that kind of s**ks'. A bit more effort could've turned it around. This is something an agent / editor should've realized, for I can absolutely understand how much pressure the author was (or so I imagine) under writing the ending.Are you the mood for a dystopian romance with the dreamy flair of a modern reality television show? If so - this fantastic novel is the book to read. 4.5 stars to The Selection by Kiera Cass.Beware of Spoilers!A few of my favorite quotes for those of you who are interested: 'You can't expect to be able to provide everything for everyone you love.' 'I loved him, and how it felt to be loved by him. I felt special, priceless, irreplaceable.' 'I would be the best of us, the Highest of the Lows. It gave me a sense of purpose.' 'I'm not fighting. My plan is to enjoy the food until you kick me out.' ''funny laugh, but it's cute ' Sure, if you like the lovable sound of an asthma attack in your ear'' ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Wow, I had to push myself through this book. Between the movie preview and the 5 star reviews, I gave THE HOST another chance (lost interest a year ago after chapter 2). This time I was optimistic about it developing into a moving story. Despite my disdain for S.M's hideous overuse of adverbs and said-bookisms, I knew she was a superb storyteller, so I let myself be drawn into the exciting premise of Melanie meeting Jared again, and having to prove she was still her, even though her eyes reflected the truth that a different soul also lived in her.But this was \"Wanderer's\" story, and I found her ... robotic and mundane (for the first 9 chapters, especially). She had NO humour, NO goals (apart from smother Melanie out of her body), NO hobbies, NO friends or family, NO personality. So I had NO compassion for her. I also loathed her telling me, a human, over and over what it was like to be in a human's body. Tell me something I don't know! And I SO wasn't interested in her other planets and \"hosts\": those details were very uninteresting and gross (the fact that she'd liked sharing one of a huge alien \"spider's\" 3 brains made me disconnect with her further).I still have great admiration for S. Meyer for creating such mystery around the character of Edward, in Twilight, and if the POV character in THE HOST had have been Jared, Meyer could have created a similar chemistry. Jared's re-discovery of Melanie could've been as exciting as Bella being told by Edward all his secrets and intricacies. We would have been fearful for Jared to trust Melanie again, but excited that she could be telling the truth. Also, her other-world and other-host details would have ACTUALLY been interesting if heard for the first time through Jared's ears. And I'm sure his time away from the cave would've been MUCH more exciting and heart-rendering (how did he deal, after seeing the face of the girl he's still mourning?) to read than Wanda's POV: every. single. detail and every. single. conversation being relayed.\"Wanderer\" was such a boring narrator, and Jared was absent for MOST of the first half of the book! I didn't understand the alien worm falling for Jared, because EYE hadn't even gotten to know him! The movie seems to correct this and play out in chronological order, and I can't help but ponder on how intensely I would have wanted Melanie and Jared to get back together if the book had STARTED with them, STARTED with Jared finding Melanie in that kitchen. I would have been riveted to the pages! We would have gone through his mourning when Melanie left him that note and felt his intense loss, felt his anguish in having to tell her brother, felt his bravery in plucking up and finding a new home, looking after the little brother of the girl he was mourning. Then we would've felt his ache and anger whenever he looked at Melanie's face, her eyes now reflective (such a cool detail by S. Meyer! What's with her and eyes? So good!). THAT'S all conflict. Very interesting conflict!The sad thing is, Stephenie Meyer HAS THIS POTENTIAL for great conflict and feelings.Anyway, I lost so much interest in the possibilities of THE HOST that I started skimming (periodically) through Wanda's cave-time during Jared's absence, and all I found was more of the same. It reminded me of Eclipse, when Bella goes to the bonfire with Jacob and we have meaningless (plot-wise) conversations that take up a whole CHUNK of that book. And the other chunks in the series where we have PAGES of inner monologues and every detail on housecleaning and hair-washing. But with those books I kept reading because I was invested in E & B's relationship.I was not invested in \"Wanderer,\" and Melanie (a more interesting, gutsy character) was fading more and more into the background by halfway. I gave up. I was so frustrated, I did more than just skim each page to the end, I skimmed every fiftieth page. Nothing grabbed me. They were STILL in the caves.Oh, and Wanderer had become so much like Bella ... minus the humour and stumbling. All that serious caring-for-others and stubbornness, yet no interests or personality of her own.I HOPE S. Meyer can write in a different POV voice! Perhaps that's why she didn't write from Jared's perspective. I haven't written her off yet, however, like I have THE HOST. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: FLAVOR:While eating the bar, I could definitely taste the cherries.  While I could feel the bits of cashew, I didn't taste them until after...there's definitely a lingering flavor of cashew after you're done.  The cherries were delicious, and they really tasted like cherries, not like cherry flavoring.  Every bite tasted like a cherry, though it was balanced with a neutral flavor that kept it from being overwhelming.TEXTURE:The outside of the bar is sticky.  The bar itself, as you bite into it, feels firm and chewy.  There are nut bits distributed throughout which give a little bit of extra firmness.SIZE:The bar itself is around 3 inches long and around an inch wide.  It's a little more than a quarter of an inch thick.SATISFACTION:I used this bar as a breakfast bar, and it kept me feeling reasonably satisfied for ~4 hours, which is about all I ask of a breakfast bar.NUTRITION:I'm no expert in this area, but I do like that this bar has no refined sugar and has a good amount of protein.  I've been trying to find tasty bars that have protein for the morning, and this is one of the first I've found.  I also appreciate that it's only 190 calories, versus the 220+ that many other bars give.OVERALL:Overall, I'm going to be buying a few packs of these in different flavors as soon as I finish this review.  I'm really glad I got the opportunity to try it, and I definitely recommend it if you like fruity and chewy bars and are looking for a high protein breakfast alternative. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is actor?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This was one of the Blu-Ray discs that I bought at the same time I bought my player, as I was guessing that the vibrant colors of this film would look great in HD.  Unfortunately, there is so much film grain and visual noise that I had to drastically reduce the backlight and the color saturation on my LCD in order to make it less distracting.  But this eliminated the primary artistic virtue of the film: its colorful palette.  If this had been what Blu-Ray had to offer, I would have returned the player immediately, as I had seen better picture quality from upscaled DVDs and from HD downloads in 720p.  Thankfully, I was guided towards \"I, Robot\" and \"Ratatouille\" and saw what Blu-Ray really has to offer, and it is worth the price of admission.  But the shoddy presentation of \"House of Flying Daggers\" nearly soured me on the whole experience before I really got started.I rather enjoyed this film on standard-definition cable TV when I first saw it.  The colors are marvelous, the fight scenes are fluid, and the plot is simple but effective.  The main character, Wind, is kind of a jerk at first, but he grows on you a little by the end.  I would describe the acting as competent, even a bit above-average for what you'd expect.  For a foreign language film, we English-speaking viewers need decent acting through facial expressions and body language, and there's enough here to adequately serve the story.I don't know what equipment was used to shoot this film, but I hope that a great transfer could be done one day when Blu-Ray has settled into its place as the dominant disc format.  This is the type of film that has great potential as an HD viewing experience, but it hasn't come close to realizing that quite yet.  If you have and enjoy the DVD of this movie, I would recommend against buying the Blu-Ray at this time. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This was a disappointing experience. I read about Buca on Eater and it was also recommended by a friend's friend. The space itself is sleek and beautiful. But it's also loud, so much so that I could barely hear my dining companions unless they were shouting. The space could use some warmth. The food was okay. We liked the garlic knots and cheese plate as well as the pastas. The carbornara stood out. The pizza was bland and warm at best. Where Buca really falls apart is the service. Now it's possible it could be remedied if you were able to hear your server. But that would mean my server would have had to come to the table. Obviously she didn't. She dropped off the menus and took our water orders. She then spent a very very long time to return, at which point we placed our orders - not just drink but for everything. It would have been nice for her to return to take our drink orders and ask us if we have any questions. After our food delivered, she all but disappeared. Not once did she come by to ask if we wanted another drink as our cocktail glasses sat empty. We had to repeatedly flag down other waitresses and bussers to get water. I had told the restaurant that we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Though none of us placed a dessert order, I thought they'd still bring something small out as most other restaurants do. I guess I could live with some of these things but not at this price point. Go somewhere else. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is it picture ?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I have been shooting motorcycle track photography for about 3 years now.  The fist year I shot with a Canon Rebel T2i (AKA 550D)  The image quality was good on this camera but the speed was lacking.What I didn't realize until I got the 7D was how much the speed was lacking.  The T2i is a great camera in it's own right and for consumers it's very good.  When I bought it I thought, hey it has virtually the same sensor as the 7D this should be good enough.Well, I had no idea how much difference the 19 cross type AF points would make, or how much faster 8 FPS was.  My keeper rate went up immediately.  Now, I realize there are other features I could mention, like the  7D is able to control off camera flashes without the use of a 500 series flash,  but really the reason to buy this camera is speed.  This is Canon's best crop frame sensor camera body, hands down, nothing else comes close.  For my purposes the cropped sensor is an advantage as it multiplies my effective focal length by 1.6 and ISO performance is not terribly important as I'm shooting in daylight.  But, I've spoken with many other photogs that have the 5D mk2 and mk3 and when they shoot outdoor sports they still use their 7D, it's AF system is just faster, as is it's frame rate and the added low light capability of the 5D is moot at 2pm outside.  Further, I shoot this camera with the double battery Canon vertical grip.  It makes for a big camera.  This fits my hand very well and the whole system feels very rugged and sturdy.  Much more so than the plastic bodied rebel.  If you are to read my other reviews you may be sensing a theme here.  Value.  This body is no exception.It's expensive for the novice and relatively inexpensive relative to other pro bodies but it defintely earns it's xD (single digit D) Canon designation.  It is a true pro body and at $1700 it's still a great deal, just look at how much you have to spend to get a 6D, 5D, or god forbid a 1D, and the 1D series are the first bodies to start to compare in terms of AF performance as the other cameras are more wedding cameras.  For the money, you can't beat the Al Servo performance of this camera.  Of course if money was no object I'd have a 1Dx and all the big boy primes but for me money matters and for my money this camera delivers pro quality.  I'm only excited now to see what the 7D mk2 looks like when Canon decides to best this legendary Camera body. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: keyboard is very responsive\n",
      "Human answer: This second Airbender iPad case\n",
      "Corresponding question: How would you describe the ease of use of the keyboard?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is my second New Trent Airbender iPad case/keyboard combo. It is a very sturdy, elegant and functional Bluetooth keyboard case for your iPad Air. It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Air in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it&#8217;s pretty heavy, although not as heavy as the original version of Airbender. The case has been obviously redesigned, and it has lost some of its bulk. The new case doesn&#8217;t come with the several layers of protection for the iPad, which made it fairly hard to put your iPad in and out.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Air almost completely, except for the screen, which is now completely exposed. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Air from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use. The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is cramped, and it will really vary from one individual to the next how comfortable you find typing on a keyboard of this size. I am fine with composing emails and typing documents that are up to 500 words in length (such as this one), but I would not consider writing the next great American novel on it.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. The design of the arm and its attachment mechanism has also been tweaked from the previous model, and it&#8217;s now much easier to adjust it and keep the iPad fixed in its place. Both the landscape and the portrait modes are fully supported. The arm is detachable, and it allows you to position the keyboard at some distance from the iPad while typing &#8211; very convenient for the times when you don&#8217;t want to stare too closely at the small screen. When attached the are is very securely fixed and it allows you for the &#8220;true&#8221; laptop use anywhere where you feel like taking your iPad Air.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model. I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Guu is most certainly deserving of 5 stars.First off...the atmosphere/service: You're always greeted in Japanese upon entering by the lively employees. (If only I could understand what they say!) Seating has been quite quick here in my experiences but I can understand that at peak times it may not be like that. There are three different types of seating setups here...bar-style seating by the cooking area, communal-type tables and then another seating area where you remove your shoes in traditional Japanese-style and sit by a sunken table. I've never had the opportunity to sit in the latter area but it looks like fun! It is a very loud restaurant so not exactly the preferred location for a quiet get-to-know-you date. GREAT location for birthday parties, as they take pictures of your party and give you a chalkboard to scroll down the birthday girl/boy's name.The food...AMAZING! You can't go wrong with your choices. I've never been let down! The bibimbap is a favourite of mine as are the kimchi udon noodles. Beer is cheap here too! The Sapporo always helps give it a more Japanese feel :)The facilities...very clean! A coat hangar area is provided which is convenient but I'm always skeptical about leaving my belongings where I don't have a direct line of vision. I'm still scarred by a previous coat-stealing experience elsewhere one fateful night.  As for the washrooms downstairs...they are impeccably clean. Each stall has its own beautiful sink (I know, I focus on little things like that hahaa) and amenities including mouthwash and cups (nice touch!).An amazingly Guu'd experience is had here ;) Run to Guu!

      "Corresponding review: So why the 5-star review, you might ask?There is just something about this movie that I can't put my finger on.  The actress playing Dale Arden (sp?) is painfully bad, especially during the football fight scene where she claps her hands, joyfully egging Flash on with \"Go, Flash, go!  Go, Flash, go!\"  Topol (Fiddler on the Roof) is over-the-top as the mad genius scientist who is the only one on Earth to realize that all of the natural disasters are a direct result of an alien attack.  Max von Sydow plays his villainous role as Ming the Merciless with \"muhahahahaha\" glee.  Timothy Dalton doles out his dalliance as Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.  Brian Blessed is priceless as Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen; how he got through the enitre movie wearing what had to be uncomfortable (and very upsetting) leather shorts is admirable.The effects are cheesy (although, at times, brilliant - The Sea of Fire near the beginning is still eye candy for me).  The acting is campy.  The drama is laughable.So why does it continue to fascinate me?  Despite its horrible trappings as a stand-alone movie, it truly is an embodiment of the Saturday morning serial (which Star Wars PROFESSES to be, but has degenerated into a contest of making something fake look real).  With THAT in mind, the movie plays out as good, cheesy campy fun and always has you wondering how the hero continues to cheat death in a nearly 2-hour movie (as opposed to the next weekly installment).  The matter-of-fact discussions about Earth's imminent destruction, our hero and damsel-in-distress somehow instantly falling in love and the inexplicable onset of early jealousy after having only traded about 10 lines of dialogue, the sometimes brilliant lines of dialogue delivered by Max von Sydow (especially how he discusses with Zarkoff why it's HIS fault that Earth is being destroyed), etc., brews an unusual beverage of serial episode fun that was purely misunderstood back when this was released.  That, and what has to be one of the most unusual (and quite good!)soundtracks by Queen--especially the In the Space Capsule theme--has me coming back and watching just another curious addition to a catalog of Dino de Laurentis films.

      "Corresponding review: First of all, The Book Thief is not a light read.  It took me a couple chapters to settle into the writing style.  The writing packs a punch and you really have to read the sentences fully to understand the beauty of them.  But this is a book that deserves your time and attention.  I have honestly never read anything like it.  First of all,  it is such a unique choice to have the story is narrated by Death.  His observations are at once detached and intimate.  He sees the overall picture, but is still affected by individuals.  It really drives home the devastation of World War II on both a large and a personal level.Secondly, the writing style itself is very unique.  Like I mentioned, it can take some getting used to, but there is real beauty in the words.  It shows how powerful words can be.  And again, it is not a book you can get through quickly, but you don't really want to either.Lastly, the characters are very very real.  They have faults.  They fight.  They falter.  But they also love and hope and dream.  There are some disturbing and some very devastating events in The Book Thief.  But ultimately, Liesel is a survivor and finds hope in even her darkest times.  She finds a way to pick up the pieces and live on, and so to do we as readers.As a warning though, the subject matter is pretty heavy.  I think it falls into that category of Young-Adult-But-Not-Really-Young-Adult.  The Book Thief does not shy away from the tough subjects of Nazi Germany, poverty, death, and war.  Some parts left me gutted, I won't lie.  But I am glad I read this book. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: 5:45 a.m. The alarm just went off. You want to be on the road before 7. You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had. And it's an excellent main course coffee too.Enjoy.

      "Corresponding review: I'm a relative newcomer to Toronto, so I didn't know a lot about Barberian's. But, I actually heard about the restaurant from someone back home in Edmonton. After doing some research about popular steakhouses in Toronto, we decided to give Barberian's a try. We made a reservation for 7 pm on a Thursday, and the restaurant was pretty packed. The interior is quite dark and a bit dingy, with old decor on the walls and lights. It is certainly nothing fancy, but we had an epic meal. The server brought out warm, fresh garlic bread and pickled carrots and pickles to start. The garlic bread was so delicious, and reminded me of something that my mom used to make. I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was really into this. We ordered the shrimp cocktail (~$29) and the escargots (~$11) to start. My husband said the escargots were pretty good, and the shrimp cocktail was just OK. The shrimp didn't seem overly fresh to me. In hindsight, appetizers were not necessary at all, because the meals are HUGE. Me and my MIL ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon (~$55) and my husband ordered the rib steak (~$57). Barberian's is known for the rib steak, and my husband really enjoyed this, but I have to say that my filet was probably the best filet I've ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. I ordered fries with my steak (delicious, but could have been hotter), and we also ordered the onion rings, which were to die for. I ate so much food that I couldn't move by the end of the meal. I did finish my steak, but it was a struggle.  The wine list is very extensive, with both expensive and reasonably priced bottles. The service was curt, but professional (exactly what I expected from the place). We will definitely be back, but will order WAY less food this time. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is an updated review to reflect my having finally gotten an unsugared version of issimo.Finally, a can of coffee without sugar.  I'm a big fan of illy coffee, and hated writing the previous review, but now that there's an unsugared version (and there might always have been, I just hadn't seen it) I can say that I'm a fan.  Yes, it's still canned not bottled and yes it's still a smallish can to those of us who would cheerfully sign up for IV coffee delivery, but those things aside, what shines out now is the good, clean, smooth flavor of the coffee.  I was able to drink it black which is pretty unusual for me.The price point is a bit lower now, which is a good thing, but it's still a bit steep for less than seven ounces of something you can brew at home.  Granted illy has always been a premium-priced coffee, but it's still cheaper to make it yourself.  However, by comparison those god-awful energy drinks, I think illy wins the portable caffeine contest hands down.  And while it's really convenient to carry a can with you, it's not nearly as inexpensive as stopping at your local S'bucks for a tall coffee. I never thought I'd have occasion to write that...Bottom line is that this stuff tastes pretty good for what it is, but a lot of my original objections still stand.  See the following for my initial review.***I really wish I knew what was up with this country and sweeteners.  These days you can barely get a cup of coffee somewhere without someone dumping sugar into it without asking.  So along comes Illy's ready-to-drink \"espresso-style\" coffee and I imagine I should have guessed that it would be sweetened.  I didn't.  It was an unpleasant shock,not only because I hate sugar in my coffee, but because you have to check the ingredient list to find the sugar. Okay, fair enough, you should look at the ingredient list on everything you put in your mouth, but it should also say \"pre-sweetened\" on the front of the can. I'm just sayin'.All that aside, and making an honest attempt to evaluate the stuff in spite of the sugar, I'd have to say that it's a good, smooth, tasty brew.  I've always liked Illy coffee and this brewed stuff isn't half bad for something that comes out of a can.  I think I'd prefer it from a glass bottle, but what are the odds of that happening? As it is, the flavor of the can isn't a huge problem, but it sure doesn't add anything to the experience.Tiny can doesn't go very far either.  Presumably the reason why Illy has produced a ready-to-drink brew is for people who want to grab a can out of the fridge and swig it down.  If they're going to heat it... well no, I don't even want to think about that.  Ugh. So it's meant to be drunk cold.  Twelve ounces would have made more sense in that case.  This isn't a tiny cup of hot espresso we're talking about, it's a cold beverage. If Illy is going to bow down to the Sugar Gods of America, they can darn well do a bit of homage to the Gods of Conspicuous Consumption, too.  But $2 for less than 7 ounces of coffee?  Thanks but no thanks as Sarah Palin famously remarked.  @2 for a 12 oz can is still a bit high, but more acceptable overall.So kudos to Illy for using sugar instead of HFCS, but points off for using any sweetener at all.  Good flavor and body, but cans just don't lend themselves to a good coffee-drinking experience.  Cans are too small and the price is too high.  Buy a tin of Illy and brew your own.  It'll taste better and you'll save money. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Hey I'm reviewing that book that everyone has already read.  It's the number one book on Amazon right now and it's sure to stay there until Ronos Part I: Catalyst comes out later this year. I bet you're dying to know what I think about The Hunger Games.  Since everyone has already read this there are going to be some major SPOILERS throughout this review.There were things about it that I liked and there were things about it that I didn't like (Duh!).  If you don't know me then I should tell you that I'm very critical of things that a ton of people like.  I hold those books/movies/TV shows to a higher standard than others.  As a result it often seems like I hate the things that everyone else loves.I didn't love The Hunger Games.  Please don't judge me.  Does it help if I tell you that I didn't hate it either?There were a lot of good things about it.  I love the setting of the world.  The country being set up into districts and being run by the capital was cool for me and I was a little jealous of the authors ingenuity.  By having the POV character not knowledgable about the other districts meant she didn't have to have pages and pages about exposition about what the major industries and cultures of the districts were.  Also, if she needed to change anything for the sake of the story she could just pretend like the protagonist was misinformed about what she knew.  It's a good writing strategy.We got to know a lot about district 12 and very little about any of the others.  That left a lot of mystery and intrigue to the world of the story.  The setting alone was interesting enough to keep reading.I think that along with the setting goes the sweet story setup for why the districts are the way they are.  The Capital runs everything everyone does to remind them about how all powerful the government is.  Just in case that isn't enough each district is also to send two kids to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games.  Twenty-four teenagers and kids trying to kill each other; the last won standing wins. That's cool.  Sure to bring an appropriate amount of antagonism to the story.The main character is Katniss Everdeen and she volunteers for The Hunger Games so that her little sister doesn't have to fight.  Katniss is a solid protagonist.  She does a lot of thinking.  Lots of the story beats take place in her head (which is why the movie is going to be lacking compared to the book) especially in the first book.  Most of the in her head stuff is about her relationship with Peeta (who has a terrible name).Which leads to the weakest thing about this book and the entire trilogy.  Peeta and the love story is straight up annoying.  Suzanne Collins is a good writer.  She knows how to describe things in a unique way and there was never a moment where I thought she wasn't trying to do a good job, except for this cheezy love story.Now I'm not one of those guys who is automatically opposed to any love story in everything.  I enjoy anything that is well written.  I'm saying that the love story feels so out of place with The Hunger Games story. I can see what they were going for.  They wanted someone in the games that was going to be very hard for Katniss to kill.  That's a good idea.  But the way they do it is no good.And there is a reason I'm saying they instead of her, the author.  The way it reads it almost feels like she doesn't know how to write those drenched in love lines that Peeta constantly rolls out.  She is so good everywhere else in the book why does she falter when talking about how much Peeta is in love with Katniss.  Most of what he says feels like a clich&eacute;.  So I'm saying they because it reads like that was something the publisher told her to include in a rewrite because for some reason in every young adult fiction the lead girl has to make a choice between two guys who both love her more than any teenager has ever loved anyone.The choice plot is now a clich&eacute;, not a convention.  Please stop boring me.The choice plot makes me upset because it's used as the climax of the first book.  That made me so mad I decided I wouldn't read the other ones.  There was no way that's supposed to be the climax of book one.  I changed my mind a few months later and read the second one where I found the real climax for book one.  It's the conversation Katniss had with President Snow in case you are wondering and it needs to be included in the first movie if you want to do it right.The games themselves were entertaining enough but they could have been better.  All the things I didn't like Collins improved for the second book.  I didn't like the supplies they needed dropping in exactly when they needed them.  It was kind of explained but not well enough.  It was a little Dues ex machina and was a lazy way to move the story forward.The best stuff of the actual Hunger Games was between Katniss and Rue. It was sad when that ended because then I knew it would go back to that lame love story.One last thing.  For a story about kids killing each other until there is only one left standing the climax in the arena was pretty anticlimactic.  I guess in the back of my mind I knew that there were two more books and that Katniss and Peeta had to survive.  There's nothing wrong with that but one of the principles of story telling is giving the audience what they want but not in the way they want.  There was never really a moment where I was excited about what was going to happen next.  It was always just Katniss and Peeta killing everyone else.  My interest spiked a little when it was down to just the two of them but it should have been spiking a lot higher for where I was in the book.A lot of the things I didn't like about this book might sound kind of petty and most people don't care about them.  It's still a good enough book and I still think you should read it if you have nothing better to read.By the way if you do have something better to read let me know what it is.  We got an Amazon gift card for our wedding and we love reading things that are awesome.  Put your suggestions in the comments. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

It tells of a family ( and a few friends) who livein constant danger in war- torn Germany.  There is an ever-prevent danger of being arrested for the slightest suspicionof disloyalty to Hitler and any of his doctrines.  No one can be trusted to keep a secret.  Into this comes a young girl witha love for books, a refugee who is Jewish and in hiding, and the girl's introduction into the dangers and heartaches ofgrowing up in a neighborhood that is rife with fear, death and suffering.

      "Corresponding review: I bought this after hearing all the references to Firefly in the bonus material on the Angel season 4 DVD, where I first saw the fabulous Gina Torres, who plays the executive officer on Firefly.Firefly is worth buying and watching.  It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (\"the alliance\").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying \"(speaks in Chinese)\".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.  It is worth buying, and taking the time to watch on DVD.PS for Chinese translations try the following website -[...] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Cannot fault the hotel location at all. Situated just off Fisherman's Wharf and right next to a supermarket this hotel is great for people wanting to be well connected to civilization. Great transport links also mean that you are well connected to other parts of the city as well.The actual room itself is fine. The bed is amazingly comfortable, but there are some very annoying features. The biggest and most ridiculous aspect of the rooms are the abnormally small bathrooms. They are so small, you can't even do a 360 in them without giving yourself a concussion. This may be fine for little people but it's simply very uncomfortable for anyone over 5ft tall. The clothing hooks in the bathrooms are also so small that you cannot hang anything without it falling off instantly. This may seem very petty, but believe me, is VERY annoying.Another point worth a mention is the Air Con...it's the size of a range cooker, and earth shatteringly loud.Also, the hotel layout is like a maze, and finding your way to your room from the elevator can be an expedition.Still, if your young, healthy and consider yourself vertically challenged, this may well be the perfect place for you!

      "Corresponding review: Ive been traveling a lot and stayed in many different hotels since my job is a flight attendent and I can tell this hotel was definitely one of my favorite hotels!I traveled with husband and our 6months old daughter. Room was very clean and especially the bathroom was. We got a room with kingsize bed and a little crib for our daughter(I think it would be better if you could bring your own crib sheet and bumper since they just cover the crib mattress with normal adult mattress sheet). We stayed there for 4 nights.First day we decided to take the free ride hotel was providing and walk back to the hotel from downtown. That was little too much for us because the hotel is on high hill and we had to carry baby stuff and the baby. But if we were traveling by ourselves, we wouldve enjoyed walking even though we are not the best walkers. The neighborhood is really peaceful, nice, and well taken care.Service was really great. We didn't have much time to plan about our tirp before we went there, but the first day we got there, the staff showed our room explained about the city and recommended places to go and that helped out a lot. Very small details about their service impressed us.Paking around the hotel wasn't hard at all and we didn't pay anything for parking(compare to the hotels in downtowny that you need to pay about $40-50 for parking per day, it wonderful). Free internet access was pleasant as well. Iron board, iron that they had in the roon were clean, too(it doesnt happen with every hotel in my experience). Also complementary continental breakfast was really wonderful. Fresh baked bread was prepared everymorning and great staff delivers you freshly brewed latte or cappucinno. Usually I don't expect much with complementary breakfast(especially when it's continental) but it nicely filled us up every morning. We enjoyed good price room service sandwiches very much as well.I really think it was great choice and would go back to this one when we go back to visit San Francisco. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough.  Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a \"muscular nerd,\" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in \"glamour\" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.Set in a small town in rural Idaho, \"Napoleon Dynamite\" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite \"fit in\" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the \"teen years.\"  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, \"Napoleon Dynamite\" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.\"Napoleon Dynamite\" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.

At first we worried about being cramped, but once in and organized, it was more than enough room (so much to see you don't spent too much time in it!)Some of the reviews we read talked about how noisy it is. The cable car stop is just outside the front door. Very convenient, but they do make a bit of noise. We found the busker's in union square made more noise than the cable cars! Despite all of this we still had no trouble getting any sleep.On the second floor (i think) breakfast was served every morning,with the daily paper. Was very well stocked with heaps of choice.The internet was good and well priced( $5 for 20mins).Only other downside is it may have the slowest elevator in the world. My wife and I had a couple of races. She would go in the lift and I took the stairs. Up 8 floors and I was only just behind...This hotel is like gateway to the rest of San Fran.

      "Corresponding review: There's a wonderful, dreamy scene late in William Landay's courtroom thriller \"Defending Jacob,\" in which Andy Barber, his wife Laurie and their accused son Jacob are all lolling in the 14-year-old's bedroom musing about decamping as a family and sneaking off to faraway, exotic Buenos Aires to start a new life out of the spotlight and free of suspicion.Jacob asks, \"Is that true, Dad? Lots of beautiful women in Buenos Aires?\"\"That's what I hear.\"Laurie describes the South American city as a place of possibility where her son \"will have children, and his children will have children and he'll bring so much happiness to so many people that no one will ever believe that once upon a time in America people said horrible things about him.\"At this point in Jacob's first-degree murder trial it's evident to all three and to us that none of that is likely to happen, but still they can imagine and try to cope with an increasingly dark reality filled with dread and edging toward despair.Jacob has been charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of classmate Ben Rifkin, a bully. Jacob's father, an assistant DA until the indictment, is helping with his son's defense. He narrates the story, which is a suspenseful legal thriller that spirals into a harrowing story of family dissolution.Carefully plotted as any whodunit you've ever read, the theme takes on the same nature-versus-nurture argument as William March's provocative potboiler \"The Bad Seed.\" Unknown to Laurie, Andy is the son and grandson of violent murderers and the question becomes has Jacob too inherited a \"Murder\" gene, the \"Barber Curse?\" Suspicion becomes as corrosive as rust as family loyalty and love are tested beyond reasonable limits.A great deal of the enjoyment that comes from reading \"Defending Jacob\" is the pitch-perfect dialogue. Kids talk to each other and to adults just like the kids do in your house. When Andy articulates his life-long, adoring attachment to Laurie, the language is almost elegiac and in painful contrast to the harsh reality of their current relationship.Descriptions are vivid and memorable. Jacob, Landay says, has a way of keeping his answers short \"as if every word was a stick of dynamite.\" One soft-bodied character appears as if \"His sides, belly, and tits all sagged against his black polo shirt, as if he had been poured and bagged up inside this black sack cinched shut at the neck.\"\"Defending Jacob\" is in rare company as a courtroom drama that comes along very infrequently. Its most recent predecessor, to my mind, is \"Presumed Innocent.\" Both stories had a final twist that you think you're prepared for and still it comes out of nowhere. In a single short sentence and a few words everything changes. \"Defending Jacob\" is bold storytelling, compelling reading.[4.5 stars] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I felt that Joss was over thinking some situations and not letting things fall into place naturally, but hey, she's a girl and I can understand. I also didn't feel that Joss' character was fully developed and the problems about her past were not dealt with. I don't think taking a trip fully allows one to grieve but there is a second book so maybe we'll understand a bit more laterI thought the relationship between Joss and Braden was great. Their remarks were witty and funny at times and other times I wanted to swoon. I really liked Braden's character-he seems honest and a good guy. I was rooting for them from the beginning and don't think that I stopped doing that. In other books, there's always a character that messes up and causes a breakup but I thought that this book did a better job at making situations realistic. While there was drama, it was drama that was honest and relatable... not drama that I had to roll my eyes at.I would recommend this book to others. It was a fairly quick read. I was able to do read it in a couple of hours. I was so engulfed in the book that I didn't want to put it down!

      "Corresponding question: Is this music song have a goo bass?\n",
      "Corresponding review: To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the \"comfort zone\" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Owned many mice over the years and used even more on the job and school.  This is definitely in the top 5 in my opinion.  It is comfortable to use has good placement of buttons.  Scrolling is smooth, mouse pointer operations are pinpoint.  The rubberized grips are nice and much better than the plastic on cheaper mice.It unifies with other Logitech devices through a unified receiver perfectly.  The one thing to remember is if you are not using the included receiver, you'll need another pointing device until you can pair the MK510 with your existing unified receiver. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

There was a lack of nuts and the cherry and cashew flavors just did not seem to go together that nicely.  The texture was fine (aside from the lack of nuts).The Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is definitely my favorite and worth seeking out.  Cherry cashew - not so much.

      "Corresponding question: How is the touch screen?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This tablet has exceeded my expectations.  The screen is very bright and vibrant, its processor is very fast.  Video playback is excellent.  I find myself using this tablet for everything from surfing the web to creation of documents.  Another plus point is that is has Android ICS on it, which in my opinion is way better than the previous versions.  I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.  I was frustrated when I found out the difficulties involved with getting picasa albums to sync with the gallery, but once I got it to sync it's been no problems since.  I really don't know how I got it to sync, but I went into the gallery and saw that my picasa albums were synced.  The keyboard is also nice, its keys well space for my big fingers & paired with the very responsive touch screen make it second nature to type on, to me it feels almost like typing on my desktop keyboard.  I can't wait to find out the endurance of this tablet, I'm hoping it will last a long time.03/14/2014: After a year I'm still pleased with this purchase.  The tablet works just as good as it did when I got it.  The battery life is great, I use this tablet more than my PC.  My only gripe with it is sometimes it's slow to come out of sleep mode, other than that I'm overly pleased.  I'm thinking of purchasing about 3-4 more. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How do you like the character?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Without a doubt, this is one the best books I have ever read. Although the author is a medical doctor, he possesses a special talent in writing. The story was very absorbing, engrossing, and riveting. I started the book one day around noon and I could not put it aside. I felt a strong urge to finish it as soon as possible and the next day, the book was over.The story in this book is so real as if somebody has gone through all these and is writing them. You can find all basic human emotions here together, love, hate, fear, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, selfishness, generosity, honor, piety, arrogance, deception etc.The two main characters in the story, Hassan and Amir, happen to be close friends, yet they have really distinct and different personalities. The one, who is more advantageous from almost all aspects over the other, Amir, is a superficial, unfaithful, coward boy. In my opinion, at the age of 38, he actually becomes a real man, i.e. a man of honor, righteousness and loyalty. The other character, Hassan, is genuinely, perhaps, the most decent human being you can ever come across out there. If you ever happened to have a friend like him, stick to him like you have no one in the World. He possesses all the good qualities that a human being may have, i.e. loyalty, courage, diligence, decency, integrity, faithfulness, you name it!This book is able to unearth all the humane feelings you might ever have lost and will enable you, by all means, to learn the meaning of being a genuine human being again.

Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food. Personally, I like both places- I def think Khao San Road makes better Pad Thai but if I wanted noodles in coconut curry, I would visit Salad King for Islamic Noodles. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I tried this The Switch Black Cherry flavor as well as the Watermelon Strawberry.  I happen to like black cherry as a flavor for beverages, so keep that in mind as you read this review.FLAVOR:The beverage was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not at all tart.  It tasted similar to other black cherry carbonated drinks I've had.  I would compare it in taste to Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer with Switch being a tad more \"soda\" tasting.  It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.INGREDIENTS:The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.NUTRITION:One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:* 130 calories* 15 mg sodium*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.PRICE:The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as \"natural\" as say all natural juices.  However, if you want a carbonated drink, The Switch is better for you than soda. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the range?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I replaced my Trendnet 633GR router because I had a lot of high volume devices that were all consuming bandwidth and bogging each other down (Netflix, XBOX, Slingbox, laptops, etc. etc)  I wasn't getting full \"G\" speed with the Trendnet 633GR on my primary laptop so I figured I'd try out the Netgear WNDR3700.The big plus for this router is the 680MHZ CPU.  Even though I can only get data from my broadband router just so fast, the router seems to be effortlessly routing everything in my network without any slowdowns.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any range improvement in one area of my house and my main laptop is still around -60db (and about 1 MB/s)  I was hoping to get a little more but the faster router processor seems to keep the data flowing very steadily.  If I use a USB network adapter on my laptop, I get full speed.  I suppose I could blame my laptop network card for a weak antenna.As for the 5GHZ secondary band, I didn't find any use for it.  If I got further than 30 feet from the router and had any obstructions, the signal was just about useless.  I was -90db at 40 feet thru one wall and the ROKU XR failed to hook up.  I eventually just turned the 5ghz radio off on the router.One other thing I like is a guest network feature.  I can turn on a generic guest network when we have visitors and let them get on the internet.  I still have all encryption methods available.Overall, very solid router, I am happy and this router will probably last me a long time.  I found that Amazon actually beat Newegg prices by 15$...UPDATE 2/4/2010 :  I had a VPN server running with no problem on a Windows 7 64bit machine and a Trendnet 633GR Router.  I switched to this WNDR3700 for reasons listed above.  The WNDR was ALMOST perfect except I was simply unable to get the WNDR3700 to passthru a VPN connection.  I have to have VPN for my situation so the router is going back.  I noticed after a lot of hair pulling that others are waiting on dd-wrt firmware to rectify this VPN issue.  I'm surprised that this router couldn't do VPN, it seems so necessary??  I suppose I'll try it again when it has VPN capability.UPDATE 9/10/2010 : Somehow during a firmware update VPN is now working in Windows 7 64bit.  My network is flying.  5ghz is turned off because the range is so short that it is practically unusable.  5 STARS otherwise. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The blu-ray format really sharpens these movies up and brings out sharp details in the backgrounds that were never noticed before. They altered a few things from the last DVD set release. For example, they changed Boba Fett's voice to the same one as Django Fett, they made Vader yell \"nooo\" at the end of Return of the jedi, and they added some visual details that were not present from before. Overall the changes add more positives than negatives, and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesn't. I thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh, and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy. For those that don't like the changes, I think Disney will release the movies in original unaltered formats someday. These films never get old for me, and they are a treasure to have in the best format possible. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The top part of the wrapper advertises, \"Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free, Non-Dairy\" and that it's good whenever. In the spirit of whenever I decided to try a bar as my breakfast; the question I had was would one bar provide sufficient nutrition to carry me to lunch without getting hungry mid-morning. I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM. So I would count that as a success.In all fairness I must admit that my lifestyle that morning was much less than vigorous and active and one who is engaging in an active lifestyle with much physical exertion will probably need to supplement one bar.The bar is rather soft and chewy and has a fruity flavor that reminded me of dates; I checked and there are no dates listed so I'm not sure what I tasted. The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning. It is not a cookie or a particularly sweet treat but it is a tasty and convenient food. The package is easy to open if you pinch the wrapper on the front and back and pull it apart.

      "Corresponding question: How is the nuts?\n",
      "Corresponding review: First off, let's start with the product description for these cashews that appears on the product page: \"Lightly roasted with natural sea salt and a hint of pepper - Value added seasoning for the consumer who is tired of plain old cashews.\" From reading that description, one would assume that these cashews have \"a hint of pepper.\" That is not the case. These cashews are LOADED with pepper. When I first opened the container and saw these nuts, it looked like someone had wet them and dredged them in black pepper. And believe me...You can taste the pepper; and it stays with you. Very, very spicy. Too much so for me. I also agree with other reviewers who have said the nuts are too salty. WAY too salty, with 270mg of sodium in a single 1 oz. serving. Now, back to the \"value added seasoning\" description...Nowhere in the product description does it mention that these nuts have SUGAR added to them. Sugar? With salt and pepper? Add that to the \"granulated onion\" that also appears on the list of ingredients and maybe you can understand what I mean when I say that there's just a bit too much going on here flavorwise. You can't even taste the nuts!! I love cashews. And I love seasoned cashews. But these just don't make the grade. I think my biggest complaint is definitely the amount of pepper that are on these. It's WAY more than a \"hint.\" Stay away from these nuts unless you want to make your taste buds very, very angry and give yourself some major heartburn. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I was shocked with their simple menu! There aren't many items on the menu, and the price is...very cheap!!!  I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu with Meat (both pork and beef). The good thing about this place is they let you choose the spiciness level. For those who love spicy, don't forget to choose Extra Spicy. The Regular Spicy level isn't spicy at all. It comes with purple rice, and 1 egg to put in the soup. The tofu was soft and silky but the amount of meat is not a lot. The broth is flavourful tho. It was my first time trying the purple rice. It has great texture and I heard it's very healthy.They don't have many side dishes to eat while waiting for your order tho: kimchi, pickled turnip, soy bean, and bean sprouts. However, the food comes out pretty quick. The rice was brought to me in a stone pot. The waiter scooped the rice for me right at my table and I think the layer of rice they left in the pot is the burned layer. I felt awkward at first and asked my friend if I can do it myself, but I ended up watching the waiter scooped the rice lol. My friend ordered the Seafood, even though the broth was good, I only saw 1 mussel and 1 oyster in his soup. Oh well, it's reasonable and decent for the price we paid I guess. We didn't order anything extra so the bill came to $10 for each of us.The place is quite small but clean and organize. The staffs weren't very friendly but they were thoughtful enough to leave 1 menu for us because they knew we have another friend coming. They were also fast and efficient!!3 stars because I don't like their washroom ! Just very small and the pipe was leaking and water was everywhere. I wish I didn't visit their washroom so I can give them back 1 more star.:(I will definitely come back here. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: To go up the CN Tower, you can either pay thirty something dollars for the elevator ride OR you can choose to dine at the 360 restaurant (Keep in mind you have to spend a minimum amount for each person since you didn't pay for the lift tickets: i.e. you can't come up for free and just get a small dessert, you got to order a proper meal).   We got the $75 Prix-fixe. This choice is a step up from the first Prix-Fixe option which is $65 per person. The reason we went for the $75 Prix-Fixe was because we just liked the appetizer and main menu options better than the other one. They also serve you a small pre-appetizer dish, which so very small, but delicious nonetheless. We tried the Sesame Albacore Tuna and liked it a lot. For the appetizer, I got the clam chowder and my girlfriend tried the smoked salmon appetizer, both were good. For main, we both got sirloin steak, I got mine medium, and she got hers medium well. The steaks were both seasoned very well and very good , mine was nice , moist and juicy, hers however was a bit on the dry side. After trying my steak she wished she had gotten a medium steak as well! For dessert we both got the Dark Chocolate Tower with sour cherries. The dessert really wasn't as good as we thought it would be. It was kind of plain, not chocolaty enough , not really as sweet as other dark chocolate cakes we are used to, but someone who likes their dessert less sweet might like this cake, the two of us not so much. In the end, we spent about 2 hours in the dining area, we  enjoyed our meal and especially the 360 degree view which was super nice, and then we spent about an hour at the look out area up stairs.The Service was excellent; out server was very personable and quite  knowledgeable and gave us a lot of info about the history of restaurant and answered our random questions about the  different parts of city we could see from up there! Overall, the food was pretty good, price sort of high but you get a pretty amazing view and the food covers the lift tickets, I won't be coming here everyday, but if I have a visitor from out of town, or for special occasions, I think I'll be returning.

      "Corresponding review: Love it!It comes with the thunderbolt cable which costs a fortune when you buy it at Apple.The base adapter is excellent.You can easily attach any SATA drive to the base adapter and enjoy Thunderbolt speed.I also have 2 other Backup plus drives that has detachable adapters to USB3 and mini-USB.This makes them fully interchangeable.I tried time machine back up on 2 different macs.A new iMac (6 month), back up of 550GB, took less than 3 hours.An older Mac mini, (18 months), backup of 500GB, took less than 5 hours.As for regular save and retrieve, it is very fast.  Much less lag compared to the USB lags.I'd recommend this, but the price is a bit high. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: \"Out Live Your Life\" has been such an encouragement to me. There are a lot of books out right now about how Christians need to practice what we preach, how we need to \"get down in the trenches\", so to speak. I agree with this philosophy, and have tried to read books with this message. However, I've been very turned off by what  has felt, to me, to be an overly aggressive approach. Max Lucado's approach, however, is much different. He definitely gets the message across, the message of truly being proactive about positively affecting the lives of others. But, he does it in such a way that the reader doesn't feel like a worm for not having done enough before.He brings home the point that Jesus chose people of all backgrounds, particularly those who were uneducated, blue-collar types, the \"everyman\" (and \"everywoman\") of society, to be his apostles and disciples to bring the Good News to the world. Lucado explains that YOU and I as the readers are the ones God wants to use now, and God doesn't want us to wait until we have more money, until we are more extroverted, until we are more patient, more educated, skinnier, can keep our houses tidier, or any other self-defeating excuse we use daily to keep ourselves from making a difference.  He wants to use each of us NOW, as we are, because now is the time that matters.\"Out Live Your Life\" is inspiring, encouraging, and actually made me want to make a different out of love, rather than out of guilt. It would make a wonderful gift of encouragement for someone who doesn't quite know what he or she wants to \"do\" with his or her life--someone who feels a bit aimless (and don't we all feel that way sometimes!). I'd also recommend this book to the person who seems to have it all together, who seems completely on track, because we can all use some inspiration and motivation every now and again, and sometimes those who seem the most \"with it\" are those who internally are needing to feel like they matter.Really it's a book for anyone who wants to make a difference, who isn't sure how to make a difference, or who feels overwhelmed by the world's trouble and pain--for someone who doesn't know where to start, and even wonders if doing something will make any difference anyway. The world is so big, so full of hurt and darkness, but there is a light in each of us, and we CAN make a difference for someone! Lucado emphasizes in this book that now is the time, because God is ready to use us as we are!Disclosure: I received this book free of charge from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] blogger book reviewer program, in exchange for my honest review.

The music is chilling, the cinematography is perfect.  The theme of Mel's character's struggle with faith is powerful.But I think you must really zone into this movie to get the effect, don't watch it with annoying people that comment during the movie.

      "Corresponding review: Just returned from a week in San Francisco, staying at the Handlery Hotel.Fantastic location, being very close to Union Square, China Town, all of the major shops, the Underground (BART) and the cable car to Fishermans Wharf. You can take a train from the airport, to Powell Street station for $4.95 (then walk up 2 blocks to the hotel), saving a huge amount on cab fares! As the weather was so pleasant, we frequently walked all the way back to the hotel from Fishermans Wharf, taking in all of the sights along the way.When we first arrived, we were given a small room overlooking Geary Street, which proved to be extremely noisy (street performers, dust carts, sirens etc. etc.) So after a sleepless night we asked if we could move, which was no problem at all. The very helpfull staff at reception moved us to a much larger room overlooking the pool area, which we found to be excellent (considering what we paid and the fact that the hotel is only a 3*).In terms of eating, there are some fantastic 'diner' type places all within 5mins walk of the hotel or you can wander into China Town or even through to Little Italy where you will find some excellent restaurants.Overall, we loved San Francisco and thought that the hotel was very good, considering the price and location. We would stay at the Handlery again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

While the presentations were nice to look at,  it just didn't quite come together where it counts: on my tongue.The lakefront patio is a great visit for the relaxing view. The beer list is extensive with lots of more 'exotic' choices like $50+ bottles of beer from hidden European monasteries. If you don't have a car, or a random bike handy, it's currently difficult to get to on foot from the Queens Quay streetcar stop. There really isn't really a sidewalk on parts of the journey.

It has been a great upgrade from any wired headphones and there is no wire to mess with.Audio:Audio is basic for stereo headphones. There is nothing amazing about the base in these headphones. I have mixed the settings alot on the headphones and my phone to see what is the best I can get from the headphones. With the seetings at it's best the headphones are about basic for audio quality. I've gotten better quality sound from $15 Skullcandy headphones (Skullcandy Ink'd S2INBI-UB).Phone usage:Used them every once and a while to answer phone calls and the quality is actually great. I am heard clearly and I can also hear clearly too. The volume that you can get with these headphone is amazing. Very loud, so be careful how high you have the volume.Conection:I have been very disapointed with the conectivity of these headphones. It is rated for about 30 ft range and my headphones cut out at about 10 ft. Also when I look down, most time to see what I am doing or where I am walking, the headphones cut out. I've held the left side of the base of the headphones and aperantly there is a deathgrip in signal there.Pros:+ Great quality+ Earbuds have magnets that connect it to the base when not in use+ Vibrate and ring when call comes in (even is cell is on silent)+ Very light+ Can be very load+ Clear call qualities+ Great battery life (last me all day of ussage)Cons:- Poor audio quality- Connection limits- Deathgrip on the left side- Somestimes a little too loudGreat for what it is as a bluetooth headset for a phone, but needs to improve audio quality for it to be a great set of headphones.I would've rated these as a four star but since they are advertised as stereo headsets. It needs alot of improvement to get good ratings. I rate them as three star as headphones, but I rate them as four star as bluetooth headphones. Much better than those that just go in one ear.

      "Corresponding review: First off, we booked this hotel through Priceline. We got it from Sunday to Wednesday for $135 a night, which was a great deal and I think very good value. It's certainly worth the booking price via their own website but you can find a good deal out there for it too.The Tuscan Inn was a great place to stay. It's very close to Fisherman's Wharf, within walking distance to the Coit Tower and even Chinatown. The street cars are also only a block away. The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded. The beds and linens are quite nice too.The hotel staff are really friendly. We were very impressed with both of the concierges that were working and found them extremely useful. The people at the front desk were friendly save for one girl who we found consistently rude and abrasive. (ie, I brought a five dollar bill up to the front desk and before I could say anything she said &quot;we don't give change&quot; and walked away). With the exception of this one bad egg, everyone was very nice.The free wine/beer and coffee/hot chocolate/biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it. I would recommend making reservations at the restaurant as it quickly filled up every night and we were turned away frequently - I heard one traveller get into a heated discussion about never being able to get in for dinner.My only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not on the first floor, or a room with a view of the garden. The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am. It makes a lot of noise too - just a tip.Anyway, we loved it at this hotel and were very happy. Last word of caution - if you're going to San Francisco, don't rent a car. Parking is expensive ($40 per night) and everything is very much within walking distance. We took a cab across town and it was $10...Have fun! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the price?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Absolutely delicious! I came here a few days ago because I was craving some jerk. It's conveniently located in a plaza by Huntingwood and Birchmount that also houses some other great foods (Hunter's, the Taiwanese Fried Chicken shop, and Mexico Lindo to name a few.) I've been to Jamaica and have tasted the real deal. While this isn't exactly it, it comes pretty close to it, and I'd have to agree it's among one of the top in the city, if not the top in Scarborough! The Good: the jerk chicken meal comes in a Huge serving for about $9. Comes with about 3-4 pieces of well marinated jerk chicken (two big, two smaller sized ones,) beans and rice, some veggies, and my favourite: plantains! The plantains here are THE bomb dot com, and I don't think I've tried better ones anywhere else in Toronto. I would come back here just for a large serving of those plantains alone. That's what dreams are made of.The chicken itself is moist and well seasoned, and the servings are plentiful.The Bad: Could the chicken and rice be a little more seasoned? Hmm, yes. The rice is lacking in flavour a bit, which would be alright if they gave you enough sauce, but they don't. I had to ask for extra, and the woman gave me a bit of attitude for it, reminding me that because it was my first time, She'd give me some, but that I'd have to pay the next time. This was after I'd purchased 3 large boxes and dropped over $30 on jerk chicken. Surely you can add a few extra scoops of sauce on to your jerk chicken? No? Okay.The Ugly: Service is not the best here, except for the Asian guy in the back serving food. He always seems to be working really diligently to get stuff done. Otherwise, some of the people working behind the counter can be in a bit of a mood. They just look like they're totally over it, from both of my experiences here. If it's service you're looking for, then opt for Reggae Kitchen instead: amazing jerk chicken, great prices, and wonderful service (thanks Chris!) otherwise, Chris Jerk hits the spot and I'll most probably be back. :) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I really do like this coffee very much, though I will confess that it has been demoted to my second choice after I tasted another Community Coffee, themedium-dark Colombia Classico Blend.  That coffee is slightly less acidic, but both have a wonderful rich flavor.To me this coffee is smooth and bright, not really acidic, not bitter, and not terribly complex.  This might make it a little boring to me once I'm solidly awake, but to ease me into the morning with a healthy caffeine fix it's perfect.  I use the full 2 tablespoons of coffee to 6 ounces of water, and possibly just a little more than that.  If I use less I find the coffee to be weak, thanks to the low acidity.  Even if I use a little less coffee, though, there is still no bitterness.Even though I normally get whole bean coffee, I've found that this grind is perfect for my coffee press.I'll probably stick with the Colombia Classico, which I think has a more complex and interesting flavor, but will have no problem at all with this coffee if the other one is unavailable.  This probably isn't for someone who likes an acidic bite to their coffee, but for a smooth morning brew I think it's very good. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Well, unless it's bacon, bacon doesn't need chocolate.When I saw this Nature's Path, I thought it would be a great replacement for my typical evening treat of Cocoa Krispies. And health-wise, it is a step in the right direction. A definite plus, because I can now say \"healthy\" and \"chocolate cereal\" in the same sentence.Unfortunately, I have finally found something that I consider too rich and chocolaty. The actual cocoa-saturated oat clusters are very good, not too sweet, just the right amount of crunch (if you eat fast enough). If they'd added more than a thimbleful of the dried strawberries, I think the taste would be darned near irresistible. Unfortunately, there's not enough of the tangy berry to offset the very rich and sweet chocolate. The addition of actual chunks of dark chocolate just really take it over the top.This does make me want to try some of Nature's Path other cereal offerings, the quality of the product is very good, and the ingredients are healthy.

      "Corresponding review: The late Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's brilliant THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was originally titled the equivalent of \"Men Who Hate Women,\" and if the Swedish version was more prosaic, it better captured the overall theme of this superb mystery novel.  The story is highly suspenseful, sometimes complicated, and occasionally gruesome and disgusting.  In short, the author succeeded in creating an entertaining and intelligent novel that is also very, very blunt in its revulsion of misogyny.There are three threads to this first novel in Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  The first two threads, which become tightly woven together but which never become a single strand, center on the two main characters, the star financial investigative journalist, Mikhael Blomkvist, and the brilliant if anti-social hacker and private investigator, Lisbeth Salander.  The Blomkvist thread, which, to mix a metaphor, serves as bookends to the novel, concerns Blomkvist's attempts to expose a corrupt industrialist named Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m.  The Salander thread stitches together the recurring misogyny motif: unjustly declared insane as a child, Salander had lived in a psychiatric asylum until released as an adult under the legal supervision of a court-appointed guardian.  After her first, benign guardian passes away from a stroke, Salander is assigned to Nils Bjurman, a socially respectable but privately sadistic man who rapes her.  What guides her subsequent actions--and this is another repeating theme in the novel--is something that was taught to her by her first guardian, \"that every action has its consequences.\"  The third thread, which makes up the greater part of the material of the novel, is a stunningly well executed murder mystery concerning a prominent family headed by the industrialist Henrik Vanger.To tackle misogyny, Larsson creates in Salander a kind of super-hero.  Most of the principal players in this story are realistically depicted (well, there's the matter of at-the-drop-of-a-hat sex, which we'll get to in a moment).  The character of Blomkvist, for instance, who might well be the journalist author's alter ego, is completely believable--he is naturally drawn.  You want to believe in Salander, too, but you do so like you want to believe in Superman: someone you can trust will bust the bad guys.  Salander knows how to hurt bad men so they don't hurt back.  But as fascinating as she is--her tattoos, piercings, and other emblems of an independent spirit endear you to her--she's almost too good to be true.  Salander's not invincible--she has her own Kryptonite vulnerabilities--but she's hyper-real.  It's to Larsson's credit that the reader buys into her all the same.Perhaps not surprising is that sex plays a prominent role in a book with a misogyny theme.  But it's not all or even predominantly in the context of violence against women.  Neither is it ever in the context of traditional relationships.  Both Blomkvist and Salander engage in numerous trysts, with each other and with others, but always with friends and acquaintances not with committed lovers, per se.  The sex doesn't seem particularly joyful.  What are these frequent sexual episodes?  Do they simply reflect Larsson's version of the world, or do they convey a deeper meaning?  Is it that the world is so painful or mortality so depressing that sex serves as a drug to forget the mundane?  It's not clear.  But with the contrast of sex in different contexts in this novel the question seems to hang in the air.THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a terrific novel.  The fact that it is currently a very popular book (the cover has been ubiquitous in Christmas advertisements) just goes to show that sometimes the public gets it right.  Assuming, of course, that people are reading it.(The audio book version works very well.  Simon Vance does a fine job narrating the story.  His vocalizations of the many Swedish characters are uneven; Dragan Armansky, Salander's boss at Milton Security, for instance, sounds like Count Dracula.  Actually, more like Count Chocula.  Anyway, you get my drift.  For most of the other Swedes Vance assumes various versions of a British or \"European\" English accent.  It's not too distracting, though.  Vance's craftsmanship overall is solid.) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I first learned about this book through the National Novel Writer's Month website -- this book was listed as being written by a NaNoWriMo participant, and the author stated that this book was a product of said event.  Being a NaNoWriMo writer myself, I was heartened to learn that someone had not only published a book produced during the event, but said book had been successful enough to warrant bestseller status and a movie deal.  So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.The titular \"Night Circus\" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the \"Twilight\" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the quality of the concierge?\n",
      "Corresponding review: We stayed for one night in a room on the 11th floor. The room was small, but well maintained. We had a problem with the bathroom, though. The floor had hair on it and also the amenities kit had been used. (The cotton swab packet, which was originally sealed, was opened and missing a few swabs.) We contacted the front desk and they immediately sent a crew including the front desk manager, the housekeeping supervisor and a cleaning person. We were on our way out and they said it would be cleaned by the time we returned. When we came back, they had left a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and a nice note with an apology. And the room was spotless. (The new amenities kit had the same problem of the cotton swabs being opened but oh well.) We were very impressed. The bed in the room was very comfortable and clean. The duvet cover was clearly freshly replaced and it looks like they do that after each guest's stay. The hotel is old but charming and has a wonderful bar on the top floor (Top of the Mark) which had a band and dancing and lots of fun cocktails. The view is unbelievable. This is a great romantic hotel. The concierge was great and was able to pull some strings to get us a reservation at Boulevard while we had been unable to do it on our own. It is in a great location, right on the cable car line and within walking distance to Union Square, and lots of great shopping. It is easy to get a taxi here. Parking is expensive (about $50 or so) and internet in the room is $13. This is a classic San Francisco landmark and I would highly recommend it for any kind of stay in SF. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I bought this from Amazing Tech Depot. It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted. At this price, it is cheap enough to try out, and buy a better unit if you decide this is something you'd like to have. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: asuswrt is by far the best firmware for this router right now, unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because it lacks the features and customization I've grown to love from tomato (shibby in particular) and dd-wrt.  That said, the performance is excellent and I recommend this over it's n66u cousin.  One of the (two) wireless interfaces on this is a newer broadcom chip with more features that the twin interfaces on the n66u, so even if you don't use ac (yet), you still have a better chip at your disposal.  Unfortunately, going back to the firmware problem, you can't squeeze or customize much out of the new chip with the current firmware and lack of third party offerings, which you currently can with the n66u.just for example, the default tx power, as listed by wl, is 1500 (!) mw (using the latest asuswrt firmware).  That is about 1480 more than I'd like.  Thanks to a user named Merlin, we can download a modified version of asuswrt and customize settings beyond the webinterface, and in using it, I can set the power properly, as well as a bunch of other features (iptables droplists, upnpd custom settings, dnsmasq custom settings, hosts file, cron jobs, and more).  Even by setting the txpower to a sane setting through the webinterface, BTW, it still defaults to 1500 (or 1496ish) for some mysterious reason.  Atleast as reported by wl (the main configuration and settings program published by Broadcom).As for performance, I am very pleased.  I can break 300Mbps using an tri band N adapter w/o problem.  Also pleased with the stability.  Just wish shibby could implement the key features (speed speed speed) of asuswrt firmware into his code so I can use some of those terrific features and bypass the hideous default/stock webinterface.In short, this is a terrific router for the coming years.  At the moment however, the n66u with tomato shibby firmware is probably better.  That said, I don't regret paying the price to be forward compatible.  I'm lacking a few features I'd like to implement but the performance (speed) has been terrific and stable. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the music?\n",
      "Corresponding review: There is a legend surrounding the old opera house in Paris.  The story goes that some creature lives downstairs demanding things of its owner.  They must pay him rent and star his protegee, Christine.  But as the Phantom is finally showing himself to Christine, she is falling for another man.  And the new owners think they don't have to listen to the Phantom.  These events will force the Phantom to take action and his true nature to be seen by all.I've only seen the stage play once, so I went into this movie with very little expectations and no baggage.  I was very impressed.  There is a jaw dropping scene as we first move from the \"modern\" era black and white to the color setting of the story.  The costumes and sets are fantastic, bring the story to life in a way not possible on stage.  Yes, events from the play occur in different orders, but over all, the story is still preserved.  The music, including the new song, is still outstanding.So what's my complaint?  It's the same one I have with the stage version.  The Phantom is made out to be sympathetic.  This is even truer here as we see his past as a little boy.  The problem is he's an evil man whose true nature comes out the more people stand up to him.  I realize I'm alone in not enjoying this glorification.  At least he does realize how bad his behavior has been near the end.Overall, this is a wonderful musical brought to life beautifully on screen.  Stage purists won't like it, but the rest of us will be able to enjoy this outstanding musical. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Pixar's loss of John Lasseter's direct involvement in their day-to-day operations hasn't done them any favors (see my reviews of Monsters University and Brave); however, his influence on Disney as a whole looks to be unmistakable. Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met. There's even a comment from Kristoff to Anna where he is saying &#34;no&#34; to her about something (no, I don't remember exactly what) because he doesn't trust her judgement. All of this is a nice break from that Disney cliche.And then there's the whole thing with True Love's Kiss that they also turn on its head, and that was great to see, too. And I won't say more than that, because I don't want to give everything away. Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits. He's a great voice actor and under-appreciated as an actor in general. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Does this book have an educational purpose?\n",
      "Corresponding review: In 1933, the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed William Dodd to be the first United States Ambassador to Germany, under Hitler. Dodd, at the age of 64, would have preferred to retire from his job as a professor of the history department at the University of Chicago, and complete his memoir \"Old South.\" Out of respect for the President and duty to his country Dodd reluctantly accepted the appointment.  With his wife, Martha, an adult son and daughter, set sail for Berlin, on July 5, 1933 shortly after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany.Though appalled by Nazi persecution of Jews, Roosevelt refrained from issuing any direct statement of condemnation.  He expected from Dodd to see to it that Germany pays her debts to the American creditors. Some of State Department's most senior officers harbored an outright dislike of Jews. William J Carr, an assistant Secretary of State called the Jews \"kikes\"; Russian and polish immigrants are filthy, un-American and often dangerous in their habits (P.30). It is very disturbing to read in the book the anti-Semitism that prevailed in 1930's among many Americans. Dodd complained that there were too many Jews on his own staff. The indifference and anti-Semitism in the U.S. obviously couldn't hinder Hitler's ascent and march of conquest with tragic consequences. Dodd was one of the few voices in U.S. government to warn of the true ambitions of Hitler and the dangers of American isolationists' stance. Most Americans wanted to stay out of Europe's squabbles. In June 1938, Dodd talked of Hitler's hatred of Jews and warned that his true intent was \"to kill them all.\" (p.351)As a captive in Nazi concentration camp, I had been wondering; why the United States, a nation founded and populated by many oppressed immigrants, of different faiths, from many lands did not stop Hitler's genocide? Where were the good Samaritans among the American Christians?  They were expected to have compassionate regard for all people, not just some people! Where were the fighters for human rights? How could their humanitarian reputation be maintained when our suffering became unbearable? Why civilized nation did shirk their responsibilities to show pity for us. I doubted if the faithful, of religious denominations, said a prayer for our deliverance! Was it not a betrayal of basic human solidarity? Was it not a failure of the entire moral fabric of society? Even mass demonstrations, in the democratic countries around the world would have forced the German to stop or at least moderate their policy of Ausrottung (the extermination) of European Jewry. If President Roosevelt had been more vociferous in expressing his and the American people's indignation, the nonchalant world would have been awakened and protested the slaughter innocent people.. The indifference enabled the Nazis to victimize every Jew; subsequently not every victim was a Jew. Winston Churchill said: the Holocaust was not just a Jewish tragedy; it was the world's tragedy, because the world did let it happen.THE GARDEN OF BEASTS is compelling and horrifying. Larson is a masterful storyteller. Although much given detail does not pertain to the core story, the book based on Dodd's diary and the ancillary writings of others, is extensively researched, and very well written. The book makes history come alive. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I went on a Sunday night for dinner. They have a nice patio with heating and interesting lighting. I enjoyed the small plates of food, but nothing knocked my socks off. I did really enjoy the dates wrapped in bacon, glazed in the gooey, sweet sauce.Paella was done very well, and used great ingredients, so it's worth the $50 or so. The bottom was artfully burnt for a crispy bottom, aka. soccarat. The burnt rice was not bitter at all. I had the meat paella, and it was delish. Last time I had a seafood paella, and I definitely prefer the meat one because it just tasted more rich (surprise, surprise). No, but seriously, the seafood in the seafood paella is a bit dull tasting in my opinion. Yes, the flavour of the seafood is seeped into the rice, but I guess I just personally liked the meat one more, because it had more oomph...But they could use less salt in the paellas.Our main waiter was a bit aggressive, and was also kind of rude when we were about to pay. Generally, the other ones were fine.Their dessert menu is large and interesting. Paella is good to share between three people, or two large-portioned people, if you order a few tapas items.I wouldn't come here regularly as it wasn't THAT amazing and prices are on the high side, but it's a great place for a date or a fancy dinner.

      "Corresponding review: I used one of these for a while in my gaming rig. Here's the basic rundown:* Pain-in-the-butt to install. For AMD it requires you to remove parts from your motherboard. It also requires access to the bottom/back of the motherboard, so make sure your case has a CPU access window!* Huge! It takes up a lot of space in your case. This thing is massive!* Loud. It's not a quiet cooling solution. It gets pretty loud. I've heard louder, but not many.* Effective cooling. While it's loud, big, and a pain to install, it does cool the CPU quite effectively and handles overclocking quite well.* Complete. Everything you need is in the box. You shouldn't need to get any extra parts.My opinion is that it's a good cooler with a lot of unfortunate negatives you'd expect for a CPU cooler of this kind. No, it's not as small, quiet, or efficient as liquid-cooling, but it's also less expensive and not as complex as liquid coolers.Advice: If you're on a budget but want to overclock, this is a good place to start. If you can spend a little more, and don't mind learning to hook up a different kind of CPU cooler, then look for liquid cooling solutions, instead.If you're not going to overclock this is more than you'll need, for sure.

      "Corresponding review: Before I give my review of this book, I just want to throw it out there that I think the comparison of The Selection to The Hunger Games that some people around the internet are completely uncalled for. This book is nothing like The Hunger Games, except that there's a game people get randomly chosen to participate in. The games are nothing alike, the selection process is nothing alike, and the characters, the world, and the circumstances are completely different. Does anybody get married by the end of The Hunger Games? No. Does anyone die in the process of The Selection? No. Well, not as a direct result of the game at least, there is a war going on so I'm sure someone somewhere did die. But that's besides the point.Now that that is out of the way...This book definitely met all my expectations. It was a fantastic mix of romance, self-discovery, and even enough action thrown in to keep it interesting. Most of the characters, and all of the main had great character development, and nobody stayed stagnant for very long. The unraveling of Maxon's character and personality was done very well, and I found myself pulling for him from the first time America interacts with him.I absolutely loved America's character, and I was very glad that Cass didn't just throw her at the prince. It made America feel more real, and not just like another conniving girl after the crown. Which made it feel less like The Bachelor, and I definitely appreciated that. I don't think I would have been able to handle a book just about a bunch of girls fighting over a crown instead of trying to legitimately win the prince's heart. I also thought that the way America treats her servants in the castle is wonderful. Being from a lower caste, she understands them more than the other girls and treats them like real people.A couple of spoilers from here on out, so proceed with caution if you haven't read the book yet.I loved how America was so reluctant to enter the Selection, but does anyway to please her family and her secret boyfriend. Except that I didn't really like Aspen, and I thought he treated her terribly after their break-up. I wish she hadn't kept that last penny in a jar, but I can see the significance and the purpose. Aspen really didn't impress me much, but I feel like that was what Cass intended. Although I hope he doesn't shape up and win America's heart, part of me still thinks he'll make an effort to in the next book. And then most of me still hope she chooses Maxon.I could rant for a while about how Maxon is so much better for her than Aspen, and how much he clearly cares for her, but I'll let you read the book and make your own decision on that. It's Team Maxon for me all the way though.The history lesson in one of the middle chapters was very interesting, and I'm glad Cass included it. It's always nice to know a little bit about the world and the time period that the novel takes place in, and I think including that chapter was a great way to incorporate the information without it sounding like an actual history lesson. Or without having one of the characters randomly go off about the history of the country and the world.I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel. The ending of The Selection left me wanting so much more, and I hope the rest of the series answers the questions I have and resolves the plot in the way I hope it will. Although I'm sure I'll be happy with the outcome no matter what happens. Cass' descriptive style of writing is enough to make me enjoy the books even if the plot doesn't go how I think it should.A strong 4/5 on this one! If you haven't picked it up yet, I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little less action, great character development, and a strong female protagonist. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Although I do prefer baby food products in jars, because I reuse them for many things, I have to say that the Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food is one that I will buy despite the lack of jars.The texture is just right- not too runny, not too thick, and the color is very natural- shows a lack of manipulation or alteration.  The taste is absolutely perfect.  The food is very sweet like fruit is but not artificially so.  The greens are in the perfect balance.  Not too much to be overbearing, but the pear fruit taste balances it out perfectly. It was gobbled right up!The container is very interesting- it is flat with that screw on top.  The top has a seal on it, and is very easy to remove, but not so much that it will come off if you have to transport it.  Once you open it, the spout is easy to get the food out of, and then if you need to re-cap it, you can do so and keep the rest until the next day.I doubt that this food would last that long, however. It is so delicious that it will be finished most likely.  The packet is also fairly easy to get most of the food out of too, leaving little waste.This food is so good that my entire family right up to Daddy kept trying to eat it all instead!  It would make a great snack for traveling even for plder kids on the go (even moms).  Just enough for an energy boost and a great little snack.I can not recommend this food highly enough.

      "Corresponding review: If you want cheap Thai food this is the place to go! This place is always packed and there's always a line. But the wait isn't too long. People come and go really quick. If you don't have much time it's a good place for take out too.  Came here a couple of times already and decided to write a review. Most of the time I ordered the curry. The curry here is delicious but the rice that comes with it isn't too good.  Portions for the curry is a little small. Needs more rice. The fried rice dishes here are also pretty good. The tom yum soup here is cheap but is lacking flavour. It really sour and spicy. Wouldn't recommend it. I've also ordered the Thai street noodles. The portions are huge. There's a lot of rice noodles. But the broth lacked flavour even though it's cooked with shrimp and chicken. It was just too sour. It's so sour that the noodles taste sour. It's not salty enough. The only thing you can taste is sour and spicy. Really would not recommend. They need to make major improvements to the recipe of this. Additionally, there's a problem. The water here is tap water like most places but it has a really weird odour. You should ordered a drink instead..... The Thai ice tea is good. Overall, good for the curries ! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Is the scene of the movie great?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I never knew I could love a superhero movie so much. What made this film great was its action, story, and great characters with came together to form a near-perfect film. Usually I don't understand superhero movies; I watched all three Spider-Man movies and I still don't understand, I didn't get the second X-Men movie, and I didn't like Fantastic 4. But The Dark Knight takes a different approach for all movie goers. It's easy to understand (Usually I need a superhero guru of knowledge to explain things to me), it didn't focus too much on relationships (Unlike Spider-Man), and it was more about action than talking.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) is considered a fugitive by Gotham City, and is wanted despite his heroism and getting scum off the street like the mob groups. He eventually forms an alliance with the police and the district attorney Harvey Dent, and even his former girlfriend Rachel, and together they remove several mob groups and hundreds of fugitives are arrested. All seems to be well for a small period of time until a person known only as The Joker shows up and starts killing people, all in return for Batman to reveal himself or more people get killed. Batman becomes the most despised person in Gotham over the fact that people's lives are being taken every day because of him, and there is nothing they can do about it. So Batman must hunt down The Joker and save his friends and the citizens of Gotham City, only this movie doesn't end how you'd predict it to.MUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near-perfect film.DISTURBING FACTOR: I never expected a superhero movie to be this creepy and disturbing. There are some scenes which make this film borderline an R-rating for how violent some of them are. Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.ACTION: Lots of shooting, lots of hand-to-hand combat, lots of vehicular mayhem, lots of explosions, and even more! This is one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time.ENTERTAINMENT: This film has a lot of unexpected scenes, even things occurred that I would have never been able to predict. This film is a roller coaster ride of plot twists, adrenaline-rushing action scenes, and it's even suspenseful, all the way to the bizarre ending. This is without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite some time, and is a definite must-see for any movie buffs. You don't even need to be a fan of superheroes to enjoy this kickass movie, just go watch it... NOW!OVERALL: The beginning of the movie is slow with some relationship problems and a few other things, but when the ball starts rolling it doesn't stop and you don't want it to end any time soon.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, great action, surprisingly disturbing, little focus on relationship problems, and it's an overall kickass movie.THE BAD: The beginning is slow and goes into relationship problems, but it ends quickly at least.

      "Corresponding review: Despite the language (is it really necessary to use the f-word so often?), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Suspenseful and well-written, Gone Girl is a real page turner. I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next, but as I neared the last pages, I didn't want it to end. And then when I read the last word, I thought, \"Huh? Is that it? Are we to believe that this couple is going to stay together? Or wait, maybe Amy has something up her sleeve. Or maybe the pair from the Ozarks will arrive and throw a monkey wrench into everything.\"On the surface, the novel appears to be a boy-meets-girl story in which the characters are going to live happily ever after. They're both nice looking, educated, employed, and in love. But soon the reader learns that there's trouble in paradise and that things aren't always what they appear to be. They lose their jobs and move back to hubby's hometown to help care for his parents, her with cancer and him with Alzheimer's. That's when things really get interesting, and the reader doesn't know what to believe. Is Amy really an angel in disguise? Is Nick a cad? How can Amy be so callous in her thoughts about her parents, the people who have spent their adult lives writing about her and elevating her to fame?Gillain Flynn is masterful in creating such a suspenseful thriller. Seriously, up until the very last page the reader is wondering what's going to happen next. The scene setting, the character development, the plot twists, and the dialogue are all superb. I did wonder about a few things such as why no one listened to Desi's mother or what happened to Andie. Those are minor questions in the grand scheme of things, however.It's a powerful book, especially for those interested in the inner workings in the mind of a sociopath. You'll never see the people around you in the same way again, not even those whom you think you know best. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I really liked this book. The story line was easy to follow and while it was difficult at times to like Joss, the main character, I fell in love with Braden and Ellie! I felt that Joss was over thinking some situations and not letting things fall into place naturally, but hey, she's a girl and I can understand. I also didn't feel that Joss' character was fully developed and the problems about her past were not dealt with. I don't think taking a trip fully allows one to grieve but there is a second book so maybe we'll understand a bit more laterI thought the relationship between Joss and Braden was great. Their remarks were witty and funny at times and other times I wanted to swoon. I really liked Braden's character-he seems honest and a good guy. I was rooting for them from the beginning and don't think that I stopped doing that. In other books, there's always a character that messes up and causes a breakup but I thought that this book did a better job at making situations realistic. While there was drama, it was drama that was honest and relatable... not drama that I had to roll my eyes at.I would recommend this book to others. It was a fairly quick read. I was able to do read it in a couple of hours. I was so engulfed in the book that I didn't want to put it down!

      "Corresponding review: I have the luxury of working from home and I need a fast, reliable wireless router with good wireless coverage. My old D-Link DIR-615 was fast enough but I was never really happy with the wireless coverage. We have a 2 story home and as long as you were on the same floor, you were OK, but the other floor was spotty at best.The other problem I had with the old router was the limited number of concurrent connections it supported. As the number of wireless devices increased in the house (smart phones, iPods, several laptops, an E-reader, the Wii... you get the picture) I started getting complaints about dropped connections and/or the router being frozen.After researching what was available and working well for others, I settled on the Asus RT-N56U. The Asus has all the features I need such as high concurrent connection limits and extended range in the 2.4 GHz band (the band I use with my work laptop).So far, I couldn't be happier. The unit was easy to setup and plugged into my home network (wired and wireless) with zero issues. My work laptop now gets 5 bar - excellent coverage on both floors of my home and we have no issues with dropped connections or router hangs.We have connected the following wireless devices to the Asus with no issues:- iPhone 4s- Motorola Atrix- Blackberry Bold- iPod touch- Epson Workforce635- MacBook Pro (uses the 5 Ghz band)- Dell laptops (Win xp and Win 7)- Nook color- Wii- Samsung Blu-ray- Asus TF300 Tablet- Nokia Lumina 900- iPhone 5- iPad miniThe unit came with an older firmware, but it was painless to upgrade to the latest. I simply downloaded the latest firmware from Asus to a PC and then upgraded the router via the admin web interface.My only complaint is the bandwidth graphs don't show traffic by device. Instead, you can see the traffic by total, wired, 2.4 GHz wireless and 5 GHz wireless.One final note. I use the Cisco VPN client on my laptop to connect to the office  and it has worked flawlessly since day 1. No changes required to the client, work or the router.Update 6/11/12Just a quick update to add a couple of new devices that work flawlessly with the Asus router. We've added an Asus tablet and a Nokia phone to our stable of wireless devices. This router still rocks and delivers consistent performance despite the growing load.Update 6/22/13Another quick update to add/change devices. My wife replaced her Atrix with an iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. She is using it on the 2.4 band. We also added an iPad mini to the mix so the kids will let me use my Asus tablet. Even with these new devices, the Asus router is handling the load without issues! It's just a great little unit for what we use it for. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the soup?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Often the best hole-in-the-wall eateries have the most senseless names. I mean, who has time to knock out creatively chic names when you're so busy elevating lives with your food? Well, this is a fine example of that (at least when it comes to the naming). NO, this is not the all to familiar Japanese ramen. This is Chinese noodles at it's finest; a work of art centuries in the making -- this is LAMIAN (pronounced lie-men - pulled noodles).There's been a hand-pulled/chopped noodles movement as of late. With the very first stint(it's still there) situated in the infamous Pacific Mall, we have seen a sudden surge of such eateries all over the city. With Magic Noodles championing this movement in the north(and Scarb-area), we are seeing a better representation of this art by the day! Albeit the aforementioned is somewhat lackluster in my books.I must say these guys have surpassed my expectations a great deal. The broth is clear, flavourful and low on the grease scale. The soups are  low in sodium for Chinese standards but somehow still able to provide distinct flavours with subtle complexity. The meats in the soups are equally impressive; tender, juicy and delicious! Of course the star of the bowl is the noodles which taste distinctively handmade. Silk smooth texture all the while still maintaining that slight chew to them - absolute perfection! Even the sides are admirable.Balance, delicate, delicious, fast and affordable -- I honestly cannot find any faults, all I have are praises for this place. Definitely one of the most balanced bowl of lamian in the city. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Wow! How do you spell `Wow\" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of \"Batman Begins\".Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, \"The Last Emperor\"), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, \"28 Days Later\"), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton \"Batman\" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\", \"Insomnia\") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In \"Batman Begins\", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in \"Star Wars Episode III\". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And \"Begins\" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In \"Begins\", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood? They always have to rely on a sequel? \"Batman Begins\" was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise. And Nolan has done that. At the end of the film, there is a brief coda setting up the inevitable sequel. In this case, Nolan suggests that there is so much more to be done with the story, the characters, the villains, that I welcome a sequel.Bring on the sequels, Mr. Nolan. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Corresponding review: Not having been a fan of Johnny Cash my entire life, I didn't have any of his life details to compare while watching the movie.  I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.  I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.  This film is worth the time invested. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Really great service, fantastic location,the food though, is more miss than hit. I was sorely disappointed when the wings came through over-fried and tough like leather. We had an oyster special on one visit that were decent, kind of Rockefeller style. Salty, with intense flavor, creamy and a yummy bread crumb topping. Other menu items we had were mediocore at best. While the presentations were nice to look at,  it just didn't quite come together where it counts: on my tongue.The lakefront patio is a great visit for the relaxing view. The beer list is extensive with lots of more 'exotic' choices like $50+ bottles of beer from hidden European monasteries. If you don't have a car, or a random bike handy, it's currently difficult to get to on foot from the Queens Quay streetcar stop. There really isn't really a sidewalk on parts of the journey. Lots of overly made up people in killer heels or perfectly pressed suits. It's great for people watching. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: great district 9 was, and the enormous potential elysium had, it's obvious blomkamp has some great idea\n",
      "Human answer: citing its unique ( a rarity in films these days ) , excellent acting\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: In 2009, out of the scrapped Halo movie, first-time director Neill Blomkamp shocked the world with District 9, a very unique film about extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It currently holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting, writing, and (despite its modest budget) special effects. Naturally, expectations were high for his follow up, Elysium. After viewing Blomkamp's second film, one wonders whether he was pressed for time, because it plays out like a first draft in need of heavy revision.In the year 2154, the ultra wealthy live on Elysium, a utopian space station where crime, sickness, and war are nonexistent. Everyone else is stuck on an overpopulated, impoverished earth. One man, however, has the means to change all of that and bring equality to the two worlds.There isn't a singular flaw that can be attributed to Elysium's catastrophic failure, but \"absolutely no character development\" is towards the top of the list. Our protagonist, Max (played by Matt Damon) is an ex-con who's trying to stay on the \"straight and narrow\". It's difficult to care about him because he is essentially a cardboard cutout, like every character in this movie. The squalor the earthlings live in is portrayed with excellent, stark imagery, but viewers need more than imagery to stay invested in the \"good\" characters and their plight. \"Why should we root for Max? What makes him so special?\" It's unfortunate that Blomkamp doesn't answer these questions.Some of the characters are an extreme hindrance to the success of the film. Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, Elysium's cruel, scheming Secretary of Defense who has a penchant for poor acting including, but not limited to, cringe-inducing lines unbecoming of a two-time academy award winning actress. Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame) is meant to be a fun-to-watch villain, but Delacourt's personal mercenary has an incredibly obnoxious, pseudo-French/cockney accent that would be hilarious in a Monty Python movie, but it's distracting and less than intimidating in this one. The actors are not entirely to blame; it's difficult for a good actor/actress to perform well when given poor lines.The environments, spaceships, robots, and weapons are a visual treat, as expected. The action scenes have inventive elements, but they are too few and far between, often relying heavily on slow-motion. Ultimately, the film lacks character development and substance, both of which are essential for the kind of story Blomkamp is trying to tell.Considering how great District 9 was, and the enormous potential Elysium had, it's obvious Blomkamp has some great ideas; it's just a matter of allowing them to develop. 4/10 ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: My husband and I spent a cozy evening at home last night, enjoying OCTOBER SKY.  Based on the book Rocket Boys (BTW look at the two titles...OCTOBER SKY is an anagram of Rocket Boys), OCTOBER SKY is the story of a group of kids, growing up in a dying coal-mining town.  The launch of Sputnik captures their imagination, and gives them all impetus to learn about rockets and make something more of their lives.  With the help of a beloved teacher, the boys achieve their dreams and accomplish things never thought possible.While this story is old and familiar, OCTOBER SKY is sweet, comfortable, and very well done, keeping us interested in these characters and their lives throughout the film.  You cheer for these kids, hope for their success, and are proud of their achievements.  Sentimental and inspiring, OCTOBER SKY is perfect family fare.  The acting is well done, the photography is lovely and wonderfully atmospheric, and the story right on target.  If I have any criticism at all, it is that this film drags a bit in a few places.  But, overall, OCTOBER SKY is a wonderful feel good movie.OCTOBER SKY reminds us all to go for our dreams, because you might just achieve them.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model : the lack of a mute\n",
      "Corresponding question: What do you think of the artistic design?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I've had the original Tone headphones (HBS-700) on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year. Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal. This is personally a rare problem, but a surprising one when it occurs. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

You can walk to just about everything. However, the hotel needs a major facelift. The carpet is worn, the walls are scuffed, the rooms are dated, the window coverings were dirty, etc. I am NOT usually a picky person (and this is the first review I''ve ever written), but I felt compelled to let others know that the pics are misleading - this hotel is not as nice as it looks. Also, the coffee bar (which becomes a regular bar in the evening) is staffed by less-than-friendly employees both day and night. Downright rude, actually. I should say, however, that the front desk folks and concierge were friendly and helpful. In all fairness, I should also note that the beds were super comfy. So, if you''re not going to be spending much time at the hotel and are simply looking for a landing spot at the end of a busy day of sightseeing, it''s fine.

The widescreen format and spiffy new color made me notice things I had never noticed before such as: the inside of the White's house, the set is actually like another character in the story. I watched the extras first which set the mood in regards to how much work went into this film creatively. There is no director's commentary track. Instead there are 2 separate documentary features one about the actors experence with the film and the other about the director and crew's memories of the production. All the special features are very interesting most noteworthy is the actors behind the scenes stories. All the lead actors are interviewed with one glaring absence, John Travolta. There are many quotable lines form this film most of which are spoken by Piper Laurie (Mama) Many times my friends and I uttered such phrases as \"The're all gonna laugh at you\" or \"I can see your dirty pillows\" to name a few.

The staff was unfailingly polite, cheerful, helpful, and downright friendly--particularly Ed at the reception desk. We arrived 2-1/2 hours before the 3 p.m. check-in time, so Ed took my cell phone number and called to tell us when our room was ready. The room was large, clean, comfortable, and very light, with large windows that afforded a view of the SF skyline, and side windows that actually opened, providing welcome fresh air. We had asked for a quiet room, and our 10th floor location provided just that. Several fifth floor rooms shared a common terrace, but we were afraid that the street noise at that level might be more of a problem.The concierge (Peter) suggested we eat at Colibri, a wonderful restaurant serving Yucatan specialties, rather than the more typical fare one finds at most Mexican restaurants. The food was delicious, and the restaurant is located just around the block. Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived.The continental breakfast provided excellent orange juice along with oranges, apples, muffins, croissants, breakfast pastries, tea, and coffee in the Club Room on the hotel's top floor. Surrounding the Club Room is an outdoor terrace area that provides great views of The City.The complimentary wi-fi was a definite plus. A computer is available in the lobby for those who are not traveling with a laptop. All in all, ours was an entirely positive experience at The Donatello, and I recommend the hotel without reservation. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I was noticing various books of the trilogy in people's hands wherever I went and kept seeing it mentioned in articles getting good reviews...so I decided to try it myself.It has its good points and bad.The bad is, the book doesn't just grab you in.  It is a slow start, and I mean SLOW.  The first 50 pages or so Mikael is recalling the conversation that started the libel judgment against him.  While I understand that the story is important to the book and it's ending, it was an excruciating chapter that took me days to get through.  Once that was over, the story still moved along snail paced, going back between the lives of Mikael and Lisbeth (the girl with the dragon tattoo) separately.I continued to struggle until page 218 of 590, when something finally happened that was different and got me page turning.  After that, the book seemed to take off and from then on I didn't struggle and in 2 days I had the rest read.The good....it really is a good story, once it gets going.  I figured the mystery before the book told me, but it was a good journey all the same.  The characters Mikael and Lisbeth are good, especially when they are together, which isn't until beyond the halfway point.  In that regard, I felt the description of the book was a little misleading.  But once they are working together, it becomes a really good story and the pace really picks up.In all, if you can get through the uneventful first 200 pages, the rest is worth the time.

Once I started reading I could not put it down until I finished it. I told my husband to fend for himself for dinner, and got immersed in the Blackstone Affair. The characters are well defined and very engaging. There is a good flow to the story. And it's steamy hot. Yeah, very HOT. And that is what I was looking for. A well written, interesting, sexy story. And Raine Miller delivered in spades. The only thing that frustrated me was that now I have to wait for books 2 and 3. But as Mr. Grey taught us, anticipation can be very rewarding.

I have used the lens at a Fly-In at the local airport.  I was able to zoom in as planes landed and you can see the pilot's faces as they were landing.  Also you could get great shots of the aircraft taking off and get several shots  after they were in the air.  The shots were always sharp no matter how far the subject was away from the camera.  I remember from the old AT-1 zoom, the further the object was away from the camera the more a tripod was needed.  Not with this lens.  The IS worked very nicely and every shot was sharp.  I would recommend this lens. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I really love my macbook air, and I seriously considered buying another one for my kids to use. Then this little guy showed up. I was sold when Engadget said it was 80% of the macbook air experience at a fraction of the price. I'd say it's more like 60% of the macbook air experience, but that's still an incredible deal for the price.Drawbacks:You can't print. You can set up google cloudprint but I haven't gotten it to work yet. You can't do anything that isn't inside a web browser. 95% of my computer usage is inside google chrome anyway, so that's not a huge deal for me as a second computer. You can't edit video or do anthing else that requires more than a simple file system and a web browser.Advantages:The keyboard and touchpad are near-mackbook quality. That makes them better than 70 percent of all laptops out there. Not a small thing. I love the two-finger scrolling which you can reverse so it works like a mac. Google calls it simple scrolling. There is two-finger right click too.The screen is fine. I wish I could put the bottom-of-the-screen launcher bar on the side of the screen to save precious vertical pixels.Interface is good. I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality.

I stay in SF about 10-12 times a year, so I'm familiar with the Kimpton hotels, etc.Couldn't stay at any of my regular places because I was only there one night (on a Friday) and all were either booked or required a Saturday night stay. It was fleet week (unbeknownst to me) so the city was incredibly busy.Rooms seem to be average in size. What the place lacks in personality it completely makes up for in business amenities. I especially like the fact that I can order from numerous local restaurants via room service. Also like that I requested an early check-in (arrived at 1PM) and they were able accomodate. There are also levels of late check out that you can pay for, which is a life saver for those who may need to leave town late but want to grab a shower or a nap on the way out. Location is good if you need to be in the Embarcadero or Financial Districts, but you'll need to take a cab to get to most other places. It's central, s not more than 5 minutes from most destinations like Union Square, Nob Hill, etc.Only real problem is that getting a cab quickly in this location is not easy.

      "Corresponding review: Mockingjay by Suzanne CollinsISBN-10: 0545663261ISBN-13: 978-0545663267ASIN: B003XF1XOQPublisher: ScholasticSuzanne Collins brings us back into the world of District 13 where the rebellion is in full swing, and Katniss is out of control.Katniss is the Mockingjay &#8211; the symbol of the rebellion to all the people of the districts. She has flaunted her contempt of the Capitol twice, and they want her to do it again.She doesn&#8217;t want to. She&#8217;s injured&#8230;and scared for Peeta, who was captured and taken to Panem. They didn&#8217;t get him out of the arena.She is now dealing with a controlled existence, although it&#8217;s not like the Capitol&#8217;s control &#8211; there is plenty of food, but people have a purpose and schedule. But she suffers through being underground in safety for her family&#8217;s sake.Eventually, through much convincing, she agrees to be their &#8220;Mockingjay,&#8221; but she has her own terms for her giving the service. President Coin doesn&#8217;t like her, she can feel it, but it gets worse after she delivers her terms. But Katniss will do anything to save the lives of the victors from the arena who are now at the mercy of Panem.Peeta is one of those conditions. But, what they bring back to District 13 is an abomination of Peeta; he&#8217;s no longer himself.With her best and oldest friend, Gale, Katniss learns to be the Mockingjay&#8230;her way. She becomes not only the symbol, but the spirit of the rebellion. And, when things get difficult, she goes rogue so she can finally have a chance at ending the war and bringing an end to President Snow once and for all.This comes at a very high price&#8230;one that will haunt her for the rest of her life. Even after she decides which man she really loves and starts a life with him in peace and freedom.Again, I&#8217;m still not fond of Suzanne Collins&#8217; writing style, which I found flat and kind of dull.  And this book, more than the first two, shows off that weakness in writing. Where in the other books Katniss was strong and rose to meet challenges, in this book she was wishy-washy; instead of developing as a character, she regressed. That, on top of Katniss being injured through almost the entire book, made it slower than the previous two. I felt like the author was bored and couldn&#8217;t inject any excitement into the story because she wasn&#8217;t feeling it. The third book was disappointing for me, so much so, that I have to give it a lower rating. If I hadn&#8217;t been vested in the characters from the movies and previous books, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have finished reading it. I hope I like the movie more than the book&#8230;when it arrives. Otherwise, there were a few minor mistakes in the book with punctuation and extra or missing words here and there. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I was shocked with their simple menu! There aren't many items on the menu, and the price is...very cheap!!!  I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu with Meat (both pork and beef). The good thing about this place is they let you choose the spiciness level. For those who love spicy, don't forget to choose Extra Spicy. The Regular Spicy level isn't spicy at all. It comes with purple rice, and 1 egg to put in the soup. The tofu was soft and silky but the amount of meat is not a lot. The broth is flavourful tho. It was my first time trying the purple rice. It has great texture and I heard it's very healthy.They don't have many side dishes to eat while waiting for your order tho: kimchi, pickled turnip, soy bean, and bean sprouts. However, the food comes out pretty quick. The rice was brought to me in a stone pot. The waiter scooped the rice for me right at my table and I think the layer of rice they left in the pot is the burned layer. I felt awkward at first and asked my friend if I can do it myself, but I ended up watching the waiter scooped the rice lol. My friend ordered the Seafood, even though the broth was good, I only saw 1 mussel and 1 oyster in his soup. Oh well, it's reasonable and decent for the price we paid I guess. We didn't order anything extra so the bill came to $10 for each of us.The place is quite small but clean and organize. The staffs weren't very friendly but they were thoughtful enough to leave 1 menu for us because they knew we have another friend coming. They were also fast and efficient!!3 stars because I don't like their washroom ! Just very small and the pipe was leaking and water was everywhere.

      "Corresponding review: We watched this at the theater in IMAX 3D, so watching a Blu ray of this film at home had a lot to measure up to. I would say that it was quite acceptable. We watched it on a 55\" LG with passive 3D. The image was crisp and the 3D added, in my opinion, to the viewing experience over watching a standard Blu ray ... and I think that standard Blu rays normally look pretty good.I doubt I have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie. It takes several Marvel super-heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package. True to the Marvel taste, for most of the film they do not get along well with each other, but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds. But what else are super-heroes supposed to do? LOLThe acting is convincing, and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie (a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new Batman series).The sound in this presentation is simply outstanding. I don't remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively. The rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too. There is no problem with level balancing between the score, the sound effects and the dialogue.If you like super-hero movies, this very well may be the best one ever released. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The flakes aren't flaky, they're very dense and, well, crunchy, more like grain chips than flakes.  This is not a bad thing, it's just an observation and I admit to being surprised at how substantial the flakes were. The dehydrated strawberries and raspberries added a nice fruity kick to the overall experience.I also appreciate that there are no trans fats in this product as well, something that can sadly still be found in a number of \"healthy\" cereals currently on the market.I never add additional sugar to my cereals, they're usually too sweet as it is, but this one has a 'just right' sweetness to it, a hint really, which makes it very enjoyable without sending my blood sugar through the roof.  It's sweetened with molasses, brown sugar, evaporated cane juice, and honey, and that sounds like it would be REALLY sweet, but miraculously it's just not.You're gonna get a lot of fiber with this product, not surprising considering the density of the grain \"chips\", and who can't use a little more fiber in their diet?I will buy this product in the future.

      "Corresponding review: My husband and I stayed at the Tuscan in for three nights in November. It was our first trip to San Fransisco, and we couldn't have chosen a better spot for a getaway or for an introduction to the city. Right on the wharf and next to the trolley line, the hotel is quiet. The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows &amp; towels and smiling service. Our favorite part of the stay were the fireside evenings with complementary wine &amp; beer for hotel guests, where we met many friendly people from around the world. The whole atmosphere at the Tuscan is warm and comfortable. Morning coffee &amp; biscotti was nice too. Unless you need to spend a lot of money or crave a swanky name, this is the best...an unpretentious little jewel! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Does this product is good quality?\n",
      "Corresponding review: We were trying to live simply and watch less television. We also wanted to save some money by discontinuing our Dish Network service. At first, I was thinking about purchasing an external HDTV antennae but was daunted by the installation. I then decided to look at indoor antennas and came across the Mohu Leaf. I was intrigued that it got excellent reviews. I wasn't very hopeful because of our location. I live in Apex, NC and our subdivision is surrounded by a lot of trees and we get poor AT&T; cellphone service. But I was encouraged that Mohu has a great return policy. I figured that if it didn't work, I will just return it.I plugged it into my HDTV and had the television do a channel search. The first time I did this, I did not get a lot of channels but after moving it a couple of times (and having my TV do another channel search after each move), I was able to get 19 channels! Among a few minor channels, I got the major networks including PBS, CBS, ABC, Fox, NBC, and The CW. And guess what, at normal viewing distances, the picture quality is comparable to Dish!I'm even contemplating of buying a DVR. There are a few devices that don't even require a monthly subscription. But I'm still thinking about this. It's very tempting to be able to record all the network shows like Fringe, Desperate Housewives, or Dancing with the Stars. My main goal, after all, is to watch less television.Very soon, I will cancel my Dish service and this $44 antennae is going to save me lots of money. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How do you like the character?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Without a doubt, this is one the best books I have ever read. Although the author is a medical doctor, he possesses a special talent in writing. The story was very absorbing, engrossing, and riveting. I started the book one day around noon and I could not put it aside. I felt a strong urge to finish it as soon as possible and the next day, the book was over.The story in this book is so real as if somebody has gone through all these and is writing them. You can find all basic human emotions here together, love, hate, fear, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, selfishness, generosity, honor, piety, arrogance, deception etc.The two main characters in the story, Hassan and Amir, happen to be close friends, yet they have really distinct and different personalities. The one, who is more advantageous from almost all aspects over the other, Amir, is a superficial, unfaithful, coward boy. In my opinion, at the age of 38, he actually becomes a real man, i.e. a man of honor, righteousness and loyalty. The other character, Hassan, is genuinely, perhaps, the most decent human being you can ever come across out there. If you ever happened to have a friend like him, stick to him like you have no one in the World. He possesses all the good qualities that a human being may have, i.e. loyalty, courage, diligence, decency, integrity, faithfulness, you name it!This book is able to unearth all the humane feelings you might ever have lost and will enable you, by all means, to learn the meaning of being a genuine human being again.

      "Human answer: The auto focus is nice\n",
      "Corresponding question: How do you like the auto focus?\n",
      "Corresponding review: My first every Ebay score, the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens (featuring image stabilization) was a much coveted item around here.  It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi.Initial, first-night impressions?  Heavenly.Compared to the other lenses that I've put on the business end of the XTi, the 17-85mm is one heavy dude.  I'd wager that it's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together.  The lens is serious.  It means business.  It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today.  It's a touch of the photographic high-tech, made accessible to the amateur.With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens' barrel, it didn't feel any less heavy but \"heavy\", in my mind, became \"solid\".  The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject.  The focusing ring is also nice and big -- it cries out to be grasped and twisted.  It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on, the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments.  (The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus, that is to say.)  The zoom is also smooth, the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length.Image stabilization is also a big plus.  I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it, it will save quite a few low-light, indoor, and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens.  This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all.  Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur.  But others worked out pretty well.After having used it for about two weeks or so now, most of these initial impressions have stayed true.  The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot.  You still need to have good light and the right angle, etc.; but with the right ISO setting, it can save the scene.  The heavy feeling of the lens is something I've gotten used to pretty quickly; after a couple of sessions, you just expect the camera to weight that much -- no worries.  I've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture -- I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before.That said, I'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens' chromatic aberration.  I've had a few shots that don't seem to \"resolve\" the same way during post-processing (in Aperture) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens (e.g., the 50mm prime).  This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens -- certainly not!  But I am trying to parse my way through some of these, experimenting with some different conditions, etc. to see where it lands.  I've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one, new lens.All things considered however, I've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far....so yeah, worth it.But with respect to \"worth it\":  Canon lists a retail price of $600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.  Most places online seem to offer it in the $475-$550 range.  As far as lenses go, this is hardly a costly one.  Considering that this is one of the two lenses \"given away\" as the kit lens for Canon's 40D body, you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit...?  Just the same, this is a great \"walk-around\" lens:  it is sturdy, has some great built-in features, and has a versatile range of focal lengths.  If you got this lens \"free\" with your camera body then you are in luck.  If you're looking to pick up one separately...  Well, it's a great lens to have.  And I'm happy with mine.  But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality, previously enjoyed lenses.Happy shooting, y'all. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I like stylish hotels, this is why I chose the Adagio and here are my comments:Room: not too big but very well furnished and decorated. The design is modern and simple, there is an excellent selection of tea and coffee and the minibar has low prices. The bathroom was just OK, nothing special. Staff: I really can't understand why everybody liked the staff. We found the front desk staff very impersonal and not courteous enough. I work in a deluxe hotel in Rome and know exactly how it should be, so I even get more angry when guests are not treated in the proper way because I know what are my rights and what I should expect. When we checked in the boy was not at all friendly. The following morning I called him to say that our sink was not working properly and he told me that it would be fixed in a few hours. When I returned back in the evening, of course nothing was done and nobody apologised. As I expected, the following day as well no action was taken. I did not complain further, as I only had to stay for 4 nights in total. Parking: it is really expensive in San Francisco. In this hotel we had to spend like 35 dollars per night, which is really not comparable to the good rate we had for the hotel. Anyway, you don't have any choice if you have your own car.Restaurant: service there is excellent, the staff is great and the food is good. After 2 weeks of fast food and Mexican food, we really had enough, so we wanted to try a few restaurants in San Francisco. We noticed that there were a lot of local clients, not staying at the hotel, which is always a good sign. Food was very good, price adequate.I would definitely return to this hotel, despite the front desk staff. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We stayed three nights in late April 2008. The hotel is a bright spot in a not-so-nice area of SF (I believe the tour guide referred to the area as 'The Tenderloin'.) The hotel was inviting and attractive though. The decor is modern. We were able to check in a couple of hours early and the woman at the check in desk was very gracious and efficient. We scored a great price per night for our stay via the hotel's Website, too, which helped us to absorb the $33 per night valet parking fees (plus tips.)The room (on the 11th floor) was fairly large and clean and offered a king bed, a pull-out sofa, a refrigerator, desk, TV, radio, a small dresser and a large closet. The bathroom was a good size, too, and the water pressure for the shower was very good.There was a restaurant located on the first floor of the hotel, but we didn't have an opportunity to sample it. The hotel offers coffee and tea and apples in the lobby in the morning and late afternoon.It was a short walk to Union Square, but the hotel itself is not part of the Square. There were many homeless folks in the area, but none of them were &quot;nasty&quot; folks (meaning aggressive or insulting.) One fellow was kind enough to tell me that the meter I fed where I parked the car before checking into the hotel was for commercial vehicles only and the car could be towed while I was away. I wished that I had more cash on hand to give him for saving me from a potentially costly problem.Earlier reviews indicated that there was a lot of noise at night. Most of the time we didn't have this problem, but one night we heard very loud motorcycles starting up around midnight. After they drove off, all was quiet enough again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language \"Hellboy\". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is \"boring\" and they had to \"read for two hours\". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to \"read\" for two hours, keep on moving.In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in \"Labyrinth\" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name \"Labyrinth\" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a \"quest\" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her \"real world\" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to \"work out\" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in \"American Beauty\" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible \"Pale Man\" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the drink?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Stayed over President's Day weekend as a birthday surprise for my girlfriend. It was enjoyable and memorable.The hotel is in a wonderful location at the top of Nob Hill. We had upgraded to an upper floor room with city view, which cannot be beat. The valet service and the check-in were friendly and efficient, with our package details clearly spelled out. However, there was a snafu with the bags and I ended up having to go back downstairs to get them myself. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The room size was fairly small, not surprising for an older hotel but adequate for 2 people. Elevators were a bit slow, but acceptable considering the property is 80 years old.The Top of the Mark was great for late evening drinks (no kids allowed, drinks average $10 and proper dress is expected) with wonderful nighttime views of the city. Breakfast was outstanding, a high quality buffet with panaromic views stretching from downtown to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. There is a cable car stop outside which can get you around, otherwise you are looking at a VERY steep walk to get down to Union Square and a real killer to walk back up Powell to California Street. Checkout was a bit slow, but all charges were clearly explained, unlike some earlier posters who seemed to have problems. Maybe it helps to be an InterContinental member. The car was waiting outside with no delay.Overall, if you like a place with history and class, this is a great place to stay. The package value I received was outstanding, for $219 a great room, parking ($50) and breakfast for two ($52 value) included. Classic architecture, romantic history and a fabulous view of a wonderful city make for a memorable stay. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

We received this category of room both times and were very happy with the fact that we did not hear any street noise at all! Every evening from 5:00 - 6:00 they have complimentary wine and beer in their lobby by the fireplace. It really is a great atmosphere. The hotel is close to Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car lines.

      "Corresponding review: I've been a Superman fan for 40 years. With so many movies being made about lesser heroes, I was excited for this. The trailers looked great. And then as the film rolled I sunk lower and lower in my seat until I just couldn't stand it anymore and left when the final battle got underway. Believe the negative reviews from many of the professional film critics. Nolan might have been involved as a producer, but he wasn't the principal script writer and he wasn't the director, and that makes all the difference. The script was terrible. The direction was terrible. The only reason I can come up with for the film's popularity among so many Superman fans is that they have been so hungry for a film that they would have liked almost anything. I give it 2 stars for at least trying to make Superman relevant again.The thing to remember is that even though Superman has Kryptonian abilities, his personality is 100% human. He was raised since infancy on a farm in Kansas. He might feel different, but at heart he is a small town American and this film completely missed that. In focusing on the 'alien among us' angle, they gutted Superman's personality that was so well portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh. The Clark Kent we have all come to know and love through the years was completely missing. There were so many elements of the plot that made no sense. There was CGI overkill. Superman Returns had some plot problems, and could have put Superman in a few more action scenes, but overall that movie was far more faithful to the origins of the Superman character.The fact that Avengers was so successful should prove that a superhero movie doesn't have to copy The Dark Knight to be a hit. A superhero movie can be light, it can be funny, it can be human, and still be a fantastic movie. I have nothing to say about the relationship of this movie to recent comic book adaptations or graphic novels. As a movie, it is no better than all the other CGI-fests out there with tons of explosions and destruction. Superman is supposed to be special. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Our suite was #323, and was two rooms, with large floor to ceiling windows, fabulous and fun decor, enourmous bed with down comforter, huge plasma TV, free wireless and a large bathroom with elegant fixtures and a two-person whirlpool tub. Not to mention plentiful Aveda bath products, which were refilled daily.Everything about our stay was top-notch. Excellent customer service from valets, front desk staff, room service staff, housekeeping. They have a great wine hour from where they offer free chair massages and tarrot card readings. We took advantage of both and had a great time. Also, they offered a large selection of fine wines and were very generous with the amount they poured.We oreded a room service dinner and it was wonderful. It is served from the Grand Cafe located in the hotel and we were very pleased. They also offered a nightly turn-down service which was a nice touch. We cant wait to come back for our 1 year anniversary. Keep up the excellent work, Hotel Monaco!!!PS - I would share my photos of the room, but they look exactly the same as the ones online.

      "Corresponding review: Although I gave this movie a relatively high rating, I totally acknowledge that it could have been improved upon---i.e., less cliches, script revisions, and tighter direction.  Still, this movie has such an interesting premise, that I wanted to spend some \"time\" sharing my thoughts about it.  I'm a huge Matt Bomer fan (\"White Collar\"), and to a lesser extent, Cillian Murphy fan.  Cillian Murphy, the Timekeeper, plays a dynamic role.  You get that he can't resolve the inconsistencies of the system that he has spent the last 50 years of his life maintaining, yet like Mr. Stevens, the butler in Remains of the Days, you can tell that he has moments of real doubt whether he has wasted his life in his particular form of servitude. Yet he cannot fully admit to himself that he misspent his life, nitpicking the seconds and minutes of the poor and disenfranchised, while the wealthy can afford to loiter indefinitely. The Timekeeper has the integrity to not be paid off by billionyear, Mr. Weis, yet the Timekeeper still cannot fathom another way around the current status quo.  He is nonplussed when Will gives him enough time to spare his life.It was refreshing that the ghetto wasn't racially or ethnically segregated, just financially segregated.  A blonde-haired man with a posh British accent was the most menacing gangster in this \"wrong-side-of-the-toll\" Time Zone.I suppose in heaven we'll never age beyond late young adulthood, but in the here and now, it would be very strange to see different generations looking exactly the same age; therefore, no visibly aging actor was featured in this movie.  I haven't seen \"Logan's Run,\" but that movie apparently has a similar theme.This movie doesn't really offer solutions, but rather points out how problematic it is for the few privileged to live at the expense of the many underprivileged. This excessive wealth and out-of-proportion longevity doesn't even really make these privileged few happy, as Matt Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out. If we could all live agelessly, there would be issues of scant resources and overpopulation, yet as I chronically pester my Facebook friends, if we all went whole foods-based vegan, that could help prevent and reverse human starvation, as imported grain (now being forced fed to animals) could be redistributed to humans (i.e., a higher quality version, along with dried beans), and animals can graze on indigestible-to-humans grass, including grass clippings during the winter. (I only recently learned that the meat industry is a huge contributor to human starvation; I went veg b/c I love animals and could no longer pretend it was okay to love my companion pets while hypocritically eating meat from animals who likewise have feelings and are sentient.) This movie subtly (or perhaps not-so-subtly) preaches a dictum I first came across on a bumper sticker: \"Live simply so others can simply live.\" ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I have had it.  This mouse is terrible.  I've got a cheap bundled no-name mouse on my laptop, and I'm stealing it and throwing this one away.  Even that mouse is better than this one.The biggest problem with this mouse is the tendency to double click when a button has been clicked once.  It started two months after I got the mouse.  At first it was now and then, making me think I'd clicked twice.  Six months later, it's a constant thing, probably about 80% of the time.The tracking is also not great.  With a mouse pad it's bearable, without one it's impossible.  Either way, sometimes small movements just don't happen at all.  I'm never really sure where the pointer will be when I move the mouse.The three year battery life was good for about 6 months.  To me that's not a big deal.  I've usually got batteries on hand because we go through them quickly in remotes, so if that was the only problem with this mouse it would hardly be worth mentioning.The shape of the mouse is comfortable, and the scroll wheel is fantastic.  But the mouse really does have to work properly before those things become important.For the primary computers I've owned nothing but Logitech mice and mostly Logitech keyboards since the day I gave up my IBM tactile click keyboard.

Unfortunately, due to their location there are no breakfast eateries close by.BottomlineI would have no problems recommending this hotel or staying here again on a future visit to San Francisco.

What I would say to prospective readers is that if you have not read The Secret History, her highly acclaimed first book of some 10 years ago -- read that one first. While she is a good writer and her previous 2 novels were very engaging, this one was a little disappointing. For me the loose ends just did not come together at the end. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I was happy to review this new snack, part of the \"healthy junk food\" trend that is quickly becoming popular.These crunchy balls are really yummy, though I think some might think they're a bit too sweet.  The taste is similar to a kid's apple juice, and so I wasn't surprised to see that organic apple juice concentrate is among the short list of organic ingredients.  Organic, organic, organic.  The word appears 8 times on the back.  I don't think it really means anything.Nevertheless, the snack was very crunchy and very fresh.  They're a good size for snacking (about the size of a Whopper), they're not messy, and the bag is re-sealable.Buyers should be aware that these bags (60 grams) are rather small.  A \"serving\" is 2.1 ounces, at 60 calories, and there's four \"servings\" in the bag.  Unless you're great at self-control, you'll probably finish off the entire pouch in one, maybe two sittings.That speaks to how good they are, but you'll have to decide if the volume is worth the price.

      "Corresponding question: Does the video and pictures extremely sharp?\n",
      "Corresponding review: If Canon were to ever be nervous about the competition in point and shoot camera's, they are likely crapping themselves at this moment.  I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the texture?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I like the texture of this product; it reminds me of stone-ground or coarse-ground bread.  I am generally a fan of crackers with a cheese filling, but the flavor of the cheese filling only moderately enthused me.  I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an \"excellent source of fiber.\"  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an \"excellent\" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of \"excellent\" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of \"excellent\"?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an \"excellent\" source of fiber, or at least a \"good\" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the \"excellent\" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: and I liked Kay 's \" Tigana \" and Brooks ' Shannara books very much\n",
      "Corresponding question: Which part do you prefer?\n",
      "Corresponding review: As I write this, there are already over five hundred reviews of this book in ahead of me, so there would not seem to be much I can write about it that hasn't already been written. Given these circumstances, I'll cut right to the chase. This is a terrific book, and it is apparently just the first of six that will make up the entire \"Fire And Ice\" series.Tolkien is the standard by which I measure adult fantasy and, while my experience in this genre is limited, \"A Game Of Thrones\" is the most compelling and well-conceived tale I've found since Tolkien (and I liked Kay's \"Tigana\" and Brooks' Shannara books very much). It lacks Tolkien's deft touch of humor, but the plotting is intricate and multi-faceted and the characters have real depth, with elements of both good and bad in their personalities. Some are at once likeable but on the wrong side, and vice versa. Further, the \"good guys\" in this story are just as much at risk as the \"bad guys\". Death can strike down anyone, and it sometimes does so with stunning suddenness.The plotting is truly fascinating. Most immediately, the political and personal intrigue within the seven kingdoms is fast-moving and treacherous. But, beyond that, there is the Princess Daenerys, the last suviving member of the previous ruling house of the Seven Kingdoms, who dreams of returning from exile and reclaiming the throne for herself. Lurking beyond even that, however, is the ominous threat that \"winter is coming\". The great northern ice wall separates the Seven Kingdoms from a vague danger that is, as yet, only hinted at but which seems to be perhaps the greatest danger of all.This is great storytelling. A real page-turner. There's never a dull moment and, as a reader, I was always anxious to see what was going to happen next. I have the next book (#2), but book #3 doesn't come out in paperback for a couple of months and the remaining books in the series are farther down the line. I'm resisting the urge to plunge right into #2 for this reason, but I guarantee that I won't wait very long. Read this book. You'll be looking forward to more, too. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: So I came to Veronica Mars late in the game, and am only half-way through season one, but I have rapidly become obsessed.  I won't repeat what the other reviews have said (except that the comparisons to Nancy Drew, Buffy, and Twin Peaks are pretty spot on).  I do want to emphasize that the show isn't perfect.  Some episodes are stronger than others, and of course the premise requires a massive suspension of disbelief, but the overall quality of the series is so far above most other TV that those seem like picky observations.  I will commit heresy though, and suggest that being dropped as a series isn't the worst thing that can happen to a good TV show.  The premise in 'Heroes' had about one good season in it, and that's what we got before it started declining.  Having said that, one or a few good seasons is more than you get in most shows.  Many of the other reviewers have name dropped their favorite shows that others may not be familiar with, so I'll do the same.  Check out 'Slings and Arrows' (18 episodes total, by design), followed by 'Book of Daniel' (only 9 episodes, that was a true loss), 'Clatterford' (12 episodes), and the live action version of 'The Tick' (but not the animated version).

      "Corresponding review: If I were asked to list the top scary movies of all time, I would place John Carpenter's Halloween at the top of my list.  It is much scarier than Psycho and The Exorcist, in my opinion, and the likes of Jason and Freddy pale in comparison to Michael Myers.  Its influence on the genre can hardly be overstated; countless slasher films have been released over the last two decades plus, wherein each filmmaker consciously or unconsciously has tried to duplicate the force and power of this 1978 masterpiece of terror and suspense.  It is this movie's genre-defining influence that earns it first place in my rankings.Is the movie scary?  Yes, emphatically so.  All these years later, with audiences having a number of other slasher films under their belt, Halloween may not seem as frightening as it had to have been when it was released, but it is deliciously scary nonetheless.  The groundbreaking point of view shots Cameron employs only adds to the incredible suspense of the story.  Watching this movie alone in a dark room is probably a pretty bad idea, as is going to bed immediately afterwards.  Nick Castle's portrayal of Michael is brilliantly subtle, and the photography and soundtrack are superb.  The image of the featureless, pasty-white mask hovering above a dark set of clothes is unnerving, and the early sightings of him in Haddenfield are amazingly effective-even when you know he is there, it is sometimes difficult to spot him.  One of the best scenes later on has Michael creeping out of a darkened room; it is as if the mask just somehow emerges out of nowhere from the shadows.  Even Michael's walk and method of suddenly sitting straight up out of a prone position are amazingly impactful.  He really does seem to represent true evil, a force of nature that keeps coming and coming all the time yet is entirely human.  He is everywhere and nowhere.  The musical score is beyond outstanding; the famous Halloween theme is immediately recognizable whenever you hear it, taking you directly back to Haddonfield.  Halloween was the first true horror movie I ever watched.  I was probably around twelve at the time, and I decided I was going to watch my first horror film the proper way-in the dark, late at night.  I am embarrassed to say that I never even made it through the opening credits.  That jack o'lantern and incredibly creepy music scared the daylights out of me.While Michael is horror's most terrifying killer, Halloween would not have seen nearly as much success had it not been for Donald Pleasance's character Dr. Loomis.  Loomis' brilliant acting and forceful presence gives Halloween something its imitators don't have, and his almost philosophical musings on Michael's innate evil give this killer a depth that other slasher villains just don't possess.  Jamie Lee Curtis, of course, was also fabulous in this, her first movie role.  No other scream queen can boast of such advanced acting skills.  I didn't think the acting jobs of the other teenagers were very good, but those characters were in the movie for one reason only, and it wasn't to steal the show.The extra features on the limited edition release are pretty good.  The \"Halloween Unmasked\" featurette from 1998 delivers interviews with cast and creators (including an unmasked Nick Castle, who looks more like a professor than a \"killer\").  The extras also include several scenes shot in 1982 and added to the television version of the movie.  The first of these provides more detail about Michael's original transfer to a minimum security institution and Dr. Loomis' attempts to prevent it from taking place.  The second one is a great scene featuring Loomis telling the teenaged, pseudo-comatose Michael that he may have fooled the hospital administrators but he hasn't fooled him.  The third offers a bit of unnecessary data on Michael's motivations.  The fourth scene features some extended dialogue between the movie's three teenaged girls and is forgettable at best.  What I found most interesting was the story of Halloween's origins.  Many have forgotten or never even knew how much of a surprise hit this movie was in 1978.  It was filmed over the course of just three weeks with a total budget of little more than three hundred thousand dollars.  Donald Pleasance filmed all of his scenes in a mere five days.  The history of Halloween is really remarkable, especially when you consider the importance and influence of this movie on the genre.  John Carpenter managed to bring together everything a horror film needs to succeed, and the entire industry has been trying to match his efforts without complete success ever since.

      "Corresponding question: How about aroma?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Blackberry Vanilla is an interesting hot beverage; an herbal and fruit- enhanced product with only a small amount of real tea flavor and a taste that is dominated by rose hips, hibiscus, and berries. This flavor is one of a dozen or so in the pyramid tea family: A family of teas so named because of the pyramid shaped tea bag that is more like a net than a traditional tea bag, allowing the water to flow more freely and the tea to steep more thoroughly.Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Blackberry Vanilla has a nice aroma that features herbs, vanilla, and dark fruit with some tea lurking in the background. It certainly smells nice and the taste is good as well. But the problem is the same thing others have stated: There is no real flavor of vanilla. I expected the vanilla taste to be more noticeable, especially considering the scent, but it just isn't there.The lack of vanilla is a bit of a letdown, but if you can get past the fact that the product uses the word vanilla on the label, you will find that this is a nice cup of tea and it makes a good choice when you want a hot, after dinner drink that is somewhat dessert- like in its taste. Actually, it seems like the perfect companion to a piece of berry pie and the herbal ingredients and lack of any calories make it a good choice when you want to drink something that tastes good and not feel any guilt.Tea is one of my favorite drinks and Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Blackberry Vanilla is a good- tasting product from Lipton, the world leader in tea. I would probably like it better if there was a greater component of vanilla in the taste, but this is still a good tea and certainly worth a try. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: check in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room\n",
      "Corresponding question: Where is the check in?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This was my first experience using travelocity and decided to take a chance and book a little getaway for the Labor Day weekend. Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Probably the first thought I had about this book (after OMGOMGOMG) was that the writing felt so deliciously deliberate. The pace throughout was steady and relaxed. While I always wanted to know what happened next, I never felt a sense of urgency, which was kind of refreshing. It&#8217;s like the book keep assuring me that things would happen, and I&#8217;d be there for them, but I didn&#8217;t need to rush. The best thing, though? Many times while reading, I&#8217;d come across a sentence with words so perfectly placed that I just about squealed right out of my seat! Each time was like finding a treasure and it made me appreciate the writing so much.I have to to tell you that my favorite parts of the book were the scenes that involved Blue and her psychic family. Learning about each psychic and her abilities, quirks, and personality was so much fun. When the scenes began to shift toward the raven boys, I wasn&#8217;t as interested. Why read about normal characters when I can read about mystical characters? Although, I must say, that once the story picked up with Gansey&#8217;s quest for leylines, I was much more interested in the scenes involving the boys.One of the coolest things about this book, in my opinion, is that its magic seemed so much closer to home than most other YA novels containing a supernatural element. Perhaps because it&#8217;s tied to things like tarot cards and legendary leylines. Things that already exist (more or less) in our world. Stiefvater did a great job of taking these concepts and building on them, bringing them to life in such unexpected and interesting ways.Something I really appreciated was the way that all of the characters were tied to one another. I loved getting to see the various facets of each character when they were interacting with one another, and when they were alone with themselves. Though I have to admit that I preferred the female characters, each of the raven boys grew on me as the story progressed.Honestly, I think one of the weakest parts of the story was the raven boys themselves. Gansey is the main male character, and while I enjoyed following him on his quest, at the end I still didn&#8217;t really feel like I knew him at all. Each raven boy had his own story weaved in throughout the book, but my favorite was Ronan. Yes, the troublemaker and jerkiest punk of them all. Maybe his story was told best? Or maybe, like Blue, I felt drawn to him because he seems so difficult to impress.Perhaps the bottom line is that I got to know each character a little, but right now we&#8217;re still acquaintances. Maybe we can&#8217;t be friends until the next book?Overall, I really enjoyed the story, and the roller coaster ride that Blue and her boys went through. I&#8217;m looking forward to book two, and hope that it has just as much of the magic as did book one. Most likely I&#8217;m going to re-read The Raven Boys before book two comes out, just so I can go on the adventure all over again.[NOTE: I originally read this book as an ARC, borrowed from my sister, who gets many, many amazing things in her mailbox.] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

So this review will have a pros and cons that considers the four &#34;tv boxes&#34; versus each other.ApplePros: smooth operations as far as the software goes (best  i have used), works great with all apple productsCons: software is smooth because apple limits the developers by only allowing certain looks and interactions, doesn't work with some other branded products, very limited apps. limited processor versus some of the others.Roku 3Pros: great overall box, largest number of apps (channels), smooth operations.Cons: no real cons except the slower processor (doesn't have a huge effect now but may in the future)ChromecastPros: Cost (cheapest of the four), easy install, size (smallest), cost, cost, costCons: need a computer or ipad/iphone/tablet or some other type of controller to operate, wifi reception is a little weak, buffers more than the others, has limited number of apps, has a limited processor.Amazon FireTvPros: best processor, with newest firmware as of may 29 2014 is very smooth, rapid growing number of apps, the voice search is nice and has improved.Cons: not many, i love this guy and will probably buy another one.conclusion: the roku is a great box, it works great and has the most channels.  I hope they develop a Roku 4 soon to combat the firetv's better processor.  But roku has the best overall box, and experience.  I can't wait to see what they do next. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am outraged at the negativity toward a brilliant film. Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Elton John(Goodbye Yellow Brick Road),Wings(Live And Let Die),The Temptations(Papa Was A Rolling Stone),Duke Ellington(Jeep's Blues)and more. Outstanding soundtrack.. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Is there a point to reviewing this title? I mean really. It's almost like reviewing Lord of the Rings. Not to imply that Collins is the next Tolkien or anything. Far from it. My point it that as of penning this commentary there are more than seventy seven thousand reviews posted to Goodreads alone. Composing anything more doesn't serve much a purpose. Oh well, I review for my own amusement so let's get on with it, shall we?Collins can thank a good friend of mine for yet another five star review. Not literally of course. Having a blockbuster movie to her credit, I'm sure Collins is long past reading individual reviews. I should probably give Superman a shout out though. Without his recommendation I never would have bothered with the book in the first place. The Hunger Games first came to my attention via Goodreads and let's just say the tween hype surrounding the book was a major turn off. Much like Twilight, the book started showing up everywhere, relevant to the discussion at hand or not. I made a snap judgment and pretty much avoided the title like the plague. Then I received this recommendation. Ordinarily I would check out the blurb, debate if I was in the mood for the genre, probably browse a review or two, but I have a few friends with infallible taste in lit. They tell me I should read something and without a moment of hesitation, I track down a copy. As usual, his taste was spot on.Now I recently reviewed Susan Ee's Angelfall and I have to say, I enjoyed Katniss Everdeen for many of the same reasons I enjoyed Penryn Young. It is true, she has a certain aptitude for the bow but her talents are born out of a need to survive. She isn't perfection personified, the fantasy of every male comes in contact with or unusually gifted as say Bella Swan, Rory Deveaux, or Tessa Grey. Yes, I am that shallow. I pointed fingers and named names, but don't jump down my throat just yet. There isn't anything wrong with these heroines. I simply prefer the strength of character Collins features in Katniss as opposed to the inherent exceptional abilities of her counterparts.Moving on. For those who don't follow my reviews, I pretty much gave up on the Infernal Devices trilogy because I am sick to death of what has become a staple of young adult lit: the love triangle. Well, that and Clare's obvious obsession with Will's blue eyes but that is another story entirely. That in mind, Collins has me eating crow. I can hardly believe that in less than a month I am turning around and admitting I was wrong. Does this make me a hypocrite? Probably. Do I care? Not particularly. Why not? I'm so happy you asked.Gale and Peeta aren't engaged in a pissing match over a hopelessly smitten heroine who is all but begging to rip off her clothes. Collins, unlike some other authors, opts instead for a more conservative approach to teenage romance. Her heroine, Katniss, is conflicted but at this point in the game, she doesn't know how she feels about either boy. She has a relationship with Gale, but as yet, he has made no move to indicate a romantic interest and though she has no established relationship with Peeta prior to the Reaping, he declared his feelings quite plainly on live television. That's pretty much it. Now, I think it is obvious Collins intends to develop the idea in the following installments but she doesn't allow it to overshadow the rest of the piece and for that reason, and that reason I am willing to let the issue slide.So if The Hunger Games isn't mired is a sea of melodramatic drivel, what does Collins spend twenty nine chapters writing about? To be perfectly frank, she takes the road less traveled and offers up an honest to God, solidly constructed, fast-paced, hang on to your butts cause you wont believe what happens next, page turning piece of fiction. I wont go into the details. I'd end up spoiling something for the those few individuals who haven't yet jumped on The Hunger Games bandwagon. Suffice it to say that this is one of the few occasions I believe the author deserving of the royalties garnered through the film adaptation of their work.Generally speaking I like to add a note of criticism to my reviews, but in regards to The Hunger Games, I got nothing. Either I never identified an issue or I was so blown away by the story that I completely forgot I had one. Collins, I tip my hat to you. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The flavor was complex and delicious. I ordered it with thick noodles which I now know I prefer to thin noodles. The tonkotsu black had a very rich flavor as well and I didn't feel that the garlic oil flavor was too strong. I will say that this restaurant gets warm - this is great on a winter day but a little much on a hot summer day. The beers ($6.50 sapporo and $7.00 asahi black) are cold and refreshing though and will cool you off if you need it!

      "Corresponding review: I really did enjoy the theatrical release of 'Fellowship' and thought that, along with many others, that New Line was doing 2 different DVD releases of the film to 'cash in' on the fans.I still decided to pick up the extended version, and I feel like it was a good use of my hard-earned money.First of all, the 30 extra minutes are well used, really expanding on the characters and the world of Middle Earth.  I don't really mind the fact that it's on two discs.  It's like the intermission that the epic films like 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Cleopatra' had.  It's a chance to stretch one's legs a bit.  It probably would have been impossible to fit the 4 commentaries, the Dolby 5.1 audio track, and a DTS audio track, along with the 3 1/2 hour film without the quality suffering. The picture and audio quality are great because the film is spread out a bit.The actors that were cast in this film are fantastic.  Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, and Viggo Mortensen are particularly convincing in their roles.The commentaries are a treasure for the film buff or aspiring film maker.  It is facinating to hear 4 different angles on the film.The two discs of documentaries are superb.  I can't recall any DVD release covering the film making process in such detail.  Watching the documentaries makes me admire Peter Jackson even more than before.  He is a man who genuinely admires Tolkien's work.  He is not doing this to 'cash in'.  If he truly wanted to cash in, he could have just gone to Australia or England, found a sound stage and done the entire trilogy using sound stages and CGI. He didn't though.  He filmed the majority of the films on locations in his homeland, New Zealand, and many crews took many months recreating Middle Earth.  Peter Jackson has devoted several years to these films now and deserves the financial rewards that are coming to him.A truly enjoyable adventure and one that I look forward to reliving many times.  This set is one that really exhibits the capablities of the DVD format. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Couples are central to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER throughout its seven-year run, so how might one pair the seasons themselves?If Seasons One and Two of BUFFY are Origin Years-- establishing the show's mythos in Season One, then stretching and deepening them in year Two-- then Seasons Three and Four are definitely Years of Consolidation, playing with, clarifying and reorganizing the show's fictional universe and strengthening the bond between show and viewer before diving into the darker, riskier events of Seasons Five and Six (which we might call Years of Daring and Yearning).  (What about Season Seven, you ask? Well, let's just leave it standing alone in the corner, looking at its shoes and crying because no one wants to hang with it (and can you blame them?).\"Consolidation\" has a compromised tone to it, but that's not what I mean. Seasons Three and Four are excellent.  It's not a question of quality, which on Buffy was almost always high, but tone-- these are more playful seasons than those that precede and follow, and there's a wittiness to the way in which series creator/auteur Joss Whedon puts his characters through their paces. Season Three, in particular-- from \"Band Candy\" and \"Homecoming\" through  \"The Zeppo\" and the mayor's speech in \"Graduation Day\"-- is full of humor.The brightness extends to the show's look-- Buffy switches from darker 16mm stock to 35mm, giving the show a brighter look. We see more of Sunnydale, here too--  coffee shops, town streets, and the glowing green sign of the Sunnydale cinema. Darkness doesn't disappear-- the show, particularly in the first half of the season, is forced to grapple with the events of the season that preceeded it-- but this is certainly Buffy's most optimistic season, and that optimism may account for its popularity with fans.  Season Three was the highest-rated of any Buffy year in the Nielsens, and this year and the next were the height of the show's media buzz.It speaks volumes about how Buffy juggles tones that I can write the above with absolute conviction and then turn around and tell you that the show grapples, in its first four episodes alone, with teen suicide, homelessness, broken families, the dark underbelly of fundamentalism, the return of a murderer, the arrival of a rival slayer, and a mayor who has cheerfully sold his soul to demonic forces.  To say nothing of such Buffy staples as the horror of high school, the mendacity of teenage cliques and the glorious pain of doomed love.So, ok, \"optimism\" and \"wit\" are relative terms.  There are moments in Season Three that are heartbreaking, times when characters must grapple with fear, loss, betrayal and disappointment.  The genius of Joss Whedon and his writers is that they give the fans exactly what they want...exactly when they *don't* want it.  Whedon is not a moralist (a type that almost always comes in for criticism and mockery on his shows), but his work does have an ethics to it-- there are consequences to actions, and every moment, good or bad, always contains an element of its opposite. Ambiguity reigns in the BuffyVerse, and Season Three, for all its humor, contains moments when even the most seemingly \"innocent\" of Buffy folk are held up for sympathetic scrutiny.Still, moreso than any other season, Season Three ultimately grants its characters a level of grace and closure unusual for this normally open-ended show.  Even the \"villains\" are more sympathetic than usual, and far more out in the open.  It normally takes the show several eps to establish what fans refer to as \"the big bad\" for the year, but here, in keeping with the lighter, open tone, it's established early on (by the third episode) that the season's uber-villain is the Mayor, a deceptively young-looking family man who was granted eternal life and great power by demonic forces.  The mayor is my favorite of all of the program's \"big bads,\" a testament both to the ability of the writers to throw curve-balls at their audience and to the great humor and geniality that Harry Groener brings to the role.  Whether he's expounding on the genius of the FAMILY CIRCUS  (\"That PJ!\") or telling hard truths to Buffy and Angel, Groener always makes his villainy charming, almost incidental-- you *like* him, and he, like every one on the show, is granted moments of humanity and understanding rare in television characterizations (incidentally, it's been mentioned in interviews that the Mayor is based on series writer/producer (and later ANGEL co-creator) David Greenwalt, and once you know this, it is impossible to watch one of the many greenwalt interviews on the Buffy/Angel sets without laughing).I don't want to give away any plot twists, but I do want to make brief mention of: the arrival of Wesley-Windam Price, a character who will become more important in the program's spinoff, ANGEL;  the real-world arrival to the show of writer Jane Espenson, who will write more great Buffy eps over the remaining seasons than anyone aside from Joss Whedon; the wonderfully expanded role of Buffy's mom, played by the fabulous Kristine Sutherland, who has more good moments here than in any other year; the rough charm and deep passion Eliza Dushku brings to Faith, the rival vamp slayer; and the usual outstanding work of series regulars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanez, Seth Green, Nicholas Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, and the always amazing Anthony Stewart Head.The other way to divide the history of the show, of course, is between high school and post-high school seasons.  Season Three marks the dividing line between these two periods, and had the show ended here, it would have been logical and fulfilling, if also deeply disappointing.  The remaining seasons of Buffy find the characters shifting, growing, regressing, and hitting new depths (and the show, new heights). Challenges lay ahead, for both characters and fans, but that was good-- after all, no one wants to be happy *all* the time. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The MoKo Slim-Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7Before I give my reasons why, let me note this case comes with no instructions, like so many products. Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical.

      "Human answer: and hopefully better\n",
      "Corresponding question: Why is cook  it's just delicious?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This review is for dinner and I speculate that brunch is a different (and hopefully better) experience altogether.We visited Cluny Bistro on a Thursday night. It is quite a sizeable restaurant in the Distillery District and the decor and design of the restaurant is romantic and lovely, somewhat reminiscent of a bistro in Paris. The atmosphere is what potentially will draw me back to try brunch on the patio in the summer. However, the food unfortunately did not live up to the beauty of the restaurant itself.I would also like to note that despite the lovely display of various breads in the center of the restaurant, the bread served to our table was not as crunchy and soft as we expected. On the bread spectrum, it was more on the hard crust and dense interior side of breads, unlike what we would expect from a Paris bistro.We started with the salt cod donuts for an appetizer. It was served in the cutest little iron skillet with a side of smoked potato dipping sauce. The donuts had a thin crispy shell and a creamy inside similar to mashed potato. Despite being cod donuts, I could not really taste the cod, however they were pretty tasty overall with the creamy smoked potato dipping sauce. For main dishes, we had the hunter's stew with rabbit, pheasant sausage, and beef cheek and the veal meatball tomahawk, which was tomato braised and served with a side of gnocchi. The hunter's stew was served in a small bowl, with a side of mustard sauce and a flaky pastry bread. Although the meats were tender, the flavour was lacking depth and it was a forgettable dish except for the fact that it was quite small. The veal tomahawk was also tender, slightly better in flavour, and larger in portion. I enjoyed the side of gnocchi (garnished with parmesan and basil, to the best of my knowledge) better than the veal tomahawk itself. For dessert, we had the most disappointing praline profiteroles. Three profiteroles were beautifully plated, accompanied by chocolate chantilly, caramel crunch, hazelnut, and strawberry coulis. Unfortunately, the pastry itself was very hard and dense to the point that I had difficulty splitting the profiterole for a more manageable bite. The profiteroles were not very sweet but the delicate flavours were overpowered by the exceedingly sour strawberry coulis. The only part I enjoyed of dessert was the hazelnut and caramel crunch but I would not recommend this dessert.Honestly, I wish I could love this place based on concept and atmosphere alone, but the quality and taste of the dishes at Cluny did not reflect the price point.Overall rating: 2.5 stars ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How could you describe the journey of the book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Ironically, my first instinct seeing this book was that it would probably be a collection of subjectitvely picked research to back some unconvincing hypothesis of overstated importance.  Well of course part of that was true, after all Gladwell is a journalist and not a scientist.  However, in general, he does a great job in describing the research and its relevance to our everday lives.Blink focuses on 2 seperate but related concepts.  The first is that of \"time slicing\", which demonstrates how important information can be encoded in a very short period of time.  Most of Gladwell's examples are socioloical, and the most striking of which was research which aimed to predict whether married couples would get divorced after analyzing a single conversation with them.The other concept is how the brain acts subconsciously to certain stimulus.  Gladwell's proposal is that if we can recognize this power of the brain we'd make the world a much better place and all sorts of other grand things.  So, although not perfect, this is a good and interesting book. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace was the most anticipated film of all time.  The hype behind it was enormous.  The characters of the movie graced everything from action figures to toothpaste bottles to inflatable chairs.  So it comes as no surprise that the movie didn't live up to everyone's expectations.  Many people complained to no end about it. But, when get past the hype and internet complaints, you have yourself a pretty decent movie.  Sure it had some bad parts.  Okay, it had some REALLY bad parts. The story wasn't all that fascinating, tha characterization is weak, Darth Vader's an exuberant little kid, And Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever.  But the movie is still worthy of the Star Wars title.  I can't tell you how many times I was in gasping in awe of the sheer visuals in the film.  To me, the good redeems the movie for it's worser parts.  As for the legions of fans who hated this movie, I think they were expecting it to be like the first time theysaw Star Wars.  News flash for you folks: it's a slim chance that you'll ever have that experience again in your life.  Only the true fans can appreciate the film for what it is.And the geeks who spend all their time on the internet and complain about Jar Jar Binks? They need to get a life. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

We spent our last night at the Castle Inn and were treated better than at the Nob HIll digs. The staff was much more responsive to our needs and very friendly.

There's a great little restaurant across the intersection from them that served the best pancakes we have ever had!

In San Francisco, parking is at a premium to say the least. There's plenty of secure parking on this property. The price is a steal, the rooms are clean and quiet. It's close to the wharf and public transit. There are plenty of charming ethnic eateries around the corner. The staff is warm and accomodating. What more could you want?

      "Corresponding review: This is not your average tea experience, that's for sure! I didn't have high hopes after a disappointing experience with another Numi tea recently, but these are surprisingly good. They aren't sweet at all, so don't expect anything like the average herbal tea, or even anything strong like a black tea.Instead, these six different flavors are mild and savory, almost like a light broth. In fact I bet you could brew a few cups and use that as a soup stock. There aren't any bad flavors in the mix, although some are more intriguing than others. The \"Tomato Mint\" really didn't have much of a mint flavor at all, so I picked a mint leaf from my herb garden and tossed it in to spice it up, but otherwise they all clearly taste like they should.These non-traditional teas may take some getting used to, and people who don't like savory flavors where they would normally be sweet likely will hate this, but it definitely worked for me.

      "Corresponding review: Having never been to Canada or Toronto, I knew I couldn't leave without getting one of THE best views of such a beautiful city. The food wasn't spectacular, but paying $35 more dollars to get the view and a meal was well worth it to me. Just a few tips - - When making reservations, ask for a window seat, or you could end up towards the middle of one side. - Check the weather forecast. if it's cloudy you probably won't see much- Best time I think is sunset. It is absolutely gorgeousTo go up the needle and see the view is about $30...add another $35 and you can order off the Prixe Fix menu and eat a good meal. I tried the charcuterie appetizer, Prime Rib with roasted veggies and a potato gratin for my main course and the lemon raspberry dessert. The charcuterie came with meat and cheeses and was really delicious. The Prime Rib was good and served Medium rare, honestly I didn't care for the potatoes. The lemon raspberry dessert was so delicious, but the chocolate tower looked amazing! I had a nice glass of Malbec to wash everything down. Of course you're going to pay more to eat here then most restaurants, but coupled with the view, it's a place to go for a nice occasion or to celebrate a special event. The restaurant rotates all the way around in a little over an hour, but the views are simply amazing. Included in your meal price too, is the chance to go to the glass floor and to walk on the sky deck. Overall I had a great experience and it was the perfect ending to my first trip to Canada!

      "Corresponding review: I am an avid black tea drinker. And while I've had unflavored pu'eh tea, I've found that it tastes rather like dirt. It is very well suited, though, to be the base of a flavored tea. And that is why I wanted to give this a try.First, the good. The spicing is absolutely appropriate. I've had some 'chai' teas that are WAY over-flavored. This tea's spice is great. The cardonon is very flavorful without being overpowering.But I must say that I was expecting a more robust tea all around (pu'eh may taste like dirt on its own, but it is a pretty full-flavored tea). Even though the spice was decent, the pu'eh seemed very weak as a 'base' in this tea. So, the taste is spice and nothing behind it.I was also amazed that this tea is packaged as 'higher caffeine' because I wouldn't have known that from drinking the tea. IF there is more caffiene in here than in my customary Irish or Scottish Breakfast, I couldn't tell.So, there you have it; a 3 star tea. That may just say more about my personal taste for robust and strong teas, but if you have similar preferences, this tea may not be your cup ot tea. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I had to take off one star because it seemed like none of the staff knew whose food went where and brought the wrong dishes to multiple patrons. They brought us a salad we didn't order and then realized it was for the table beside us... Except it was the wrong salad for them too. This kinda thing happened throughout the night.

      "Corresponding review: Directed by James Cameron. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Bill Paxton.Titanic is a fictional love story about Rose (Winslet) and an `average joe' Jack (DiCaprio). Both meet on the infamous, unsinkable Titanc ship. Yeah, I just love these one-dimensional characters where the poor are the noble underdogs, and the rich are evil bastards.Ahh, we all know about Titanic, probably the most overrated movie ever. James Cameron is a fine action and sci-fi director. I repeat, ACTION AND SCI-FI. When it comes to love stories, especially tearjerkers, he has no skill. Why? The man can't write...at all...he just sucks at it. Lets face it, Terminator 2 was an awesome action movie, but the dialogue is cringe-worthy at times. And what about the end of T2? It tried to be deep and heart wrenching, but it failed and came off as stupid. Keep in mind, I love T2. I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites). But I won't pretend that it doesn't have any flaws, because it does. So anyway, you get the point. Cameron is a limited director, and shouldn't do anything besides action and sci-fi. Case in point, the dialogue for Titanic is bad too (there's too many embarrassing quotes to list). If anything, Titanic can give you some minor entertainment from it's laughable script.Instead of focusing on the real tragedy at hand, we get an unnecessary, clich&eacute; love story. Furthermore, I personally think the premise is ridiculously disrespectful. Taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story. WOW! What's next? 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side. That dirty dog!)? Why is this wrong? Because they're basicially saying, \"Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest! As long as these two get out, it doesn't matter who else dies!\". Sure enough, I've seen this movie with different groups of people, and none of them cried (or even cared for that matter) when most of the passengers were killed, but once Leonardo froze to death, then here come the waterworks! I don't care if I spoiled the movie for those that haven't seen it (since you shouldn't watch it anyway). Yep, a pathetic tearjerker ending to make the easily amused women in the crowd cry. No wonder it won so many Oscars.The acting here is pathetic. Leonardo DiCaprio was still in his teenage heartthrob phase, and didn't have an excellent director like Martin Scorsese to make him look good. As a result, his emotions seem terribly forced and unbelievable. Billy Zane is basicially the same, only twice as bad. It's quite embarrassing to watch, really (he should stick to cool movies like Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight. That was a great horror movie, and his character was pretty funny).Overall, I give Titanic * (that may be overrating it, actually). This was an insult to the viewer's intelligence, and nothing more than a dull storyline to fill out a 3 hour long borefest. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No compelling storytelling, no brilliant acting, and no interesting dialogue. Nope, it's almost worthless in every way. Yeah, the boat looked good, but they had $200 million to work with, so you knew it would. I'm sure most of you have already had the displeasure of seeing this, but for those that haven't, NEVER WATCH THIS. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: What a great movie!  Being a fan of the classic Universal monsters, I find that this fits in nicely with those movies, even though it was made independantly.  It's obvious that this movie didn't have the budget of those, but it has a lot of heart and charm.  The story revolves around a young couple, a plantation owner, and a zombie master played by Bela Lugosi.  The young couple are to be married, and the plantation owner has invited them to hold their ceremony at his plantation, but he has other plans.  He tries to woo the young lady away, but to no avail.  As a last ditch effort, he enlists the aid of Bela Lugosi.  Well, it turns out that Bela's character has plans for the young woman also.  For the rest, well, you will just have to watch and see....the picture quality on this edition is quite crisp and clear, with a couple of minor distortions here and there.  This is my first time veiwing this movie, and from what I read, this is the best copy available.  The sound quality isn't as good, and I noticed a few drop outs here and there, but considering the age and scarcity of the material, I think the Roan Group did and excellent job in restoring this fine film.  All in all, these minor flaws in quality did nothing to reduce my enjoying the movie.  The sets are amazing and the movie positively exudes atmosphere.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in classic horror movies. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I should have known Real Marriage would be controversial. It is, after all, by Mark and Grace Driscoll, and Mark Driscoll seems to be in trouble a good deal of the time. As I write this I have several friends who almost lose it when Driscoll's name comes up. I have several other friends who appreciate him, even though they recognize his faults. Why did I agree to review this book again?Well, it's too late. I did agree to review the book. I began reading, and it wasn't long before I got to some controversial bits. When Grace cuts her hair short, Mark disapproves. \"She had put a mom's need for convenience before being a wife,\" he writes. Say what? I remember being surprised by my wife's haircut one time, but I'm not sure I would have put it this way. He makes a few statements like this that made me scratch my head.Early on the Driscolls talk very openly about the struggles they've experienced in their marriage. Kudos to them for this. Their openness and honesty is important. This section is pretty raw, though, and it left me feeling a little defensive of Grace. And I've never been sure what to think about Mark's visions, such as the one he has of Grace committing a sexual sin around the time they started to date. Even if you believe in revelatory visions, it's unusual to think of one that is as sexually graphic as this one.Once you get past the first chapter, you're into the best part of the book. The chapter on friendship in marriage is good. The chapters addressed to men and women respectively are also fairly well done. The chapter on taking out the garbage -- dealing with sin and conflict -- is also helpful and important. These chapters are the best in the book.Strangely, the next five chapters are on sex. That's half the book. Sex is certainly a topic that needs to be covered, and the Driscolls do cover some important ground here. They talk about a biblical understanding of sex, and recovering from abuse, and breaking free from porn. Perhaps it takes half a book to deal with this area of marriage because we're all sexually broken, but it is a big part of the book.The most controversial chapter in the book is chapter 10, \"Can We ____?\" I have no problem with honest questions, and I'm amazed at how well some people answer them. The grid that the Driscolls use, however, is a little too simple, and it never gets to some of the deeper issues that need to be explored. I would use this chapter as a discussion starter, but a lot more needs to be said in answering some of the questions.The final chapter is a simplified guide to setting goals as a couple. It would be a useful chapter to go through as a married couple. The questions are good, and I'm sure they'd start some good discussions.I get why the reaction to this book is so mixed. Some like it, and I can see why. There is lots that's good about this book, and I'm glad the Driscolls tackle tough topics with honesty and candour. But I also get why some struggle with this book. It's a little too hard on Grace at points, a little too harsh sometimes in general. It goes fearlessly into areas that need to be addressed, but maybe a bit of fear would be appropriate.I'm not sure how long the Driscolls have been married, but it seems to be less than twenty years. At this point they have lots to share, and I'm sure their congregation is benefiting. But it may be too soon for a book on marriage.I hate pile-ons, and I really don't like that the Driscolls have become such a target. I appreciate a lot about them and their ministry, and I'm sure this book will prove useful to many. But it's not the book it could be. It's a book with good points, but with too many flaws to ignore. That's too bad, because there's so much to like about this book, but so much that leaves me feeling disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Jodi Picoult's The Storyteller is a fictional account of a young woman-Sage- who befriends an older gentleman-Josef- she meets at a grief group. Both  Sage and Josef are lonely and seeking companionship, and both are stuggling to cope with secrets that have led them to the therapy group. As the novel progresses, Josef reveals to Sage that he was a member of the SS who held a high position at Auschwitz- the largest death camp in all of Europe during WWII.  Josef has hidden his secret for many years by hiding in plain sight. He is an upstanding member of the community and a beloved neighbor, teacher and friend.  As he nears the end of his life he seeks forgiveness for the atrocities he committed during the war.  Sage, the grandaughter of an Auschwitz survivor, grapples with the idea of forgivness throughout the text.In the seven years I have spent as a classroom teacher, it never fails that my students ask me the following questions: How did normal citizens become Nazis? Why would any person allow such horrors to happen?  Over the years, my answer to them has evolved.  I have come to believe that all people are capable of both good and evil, depending on their environment.  It is interesting fodder for a debate on nature vs. nurture that always sparks their interest.  The Storyteller also zeros in on this idea.  Is someone that commits unspeakably evil acts a monster? Can one ever be forgiven for such things?  Told multiple perspectives, Picoult has obviously done her research. Wrapped within the stories of the characters is also an allegory written by Sage's grandmother as a young woman.  Essentially Picoult has written two novels in one in a way that is absolutely masterful.I have read  many pieces of Holocaust Literature- both fiction and non-fiction. It is a genre that I feel absolutely compelled to read.  Though it did have a few minor flaws, this particular piece was especially well done. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

On their fifth wedding anniversary, a day Amy always celebrates to the hilt, she disappears under mysterious circumstances.

Thus begins a highly suspenseful tale loaded with twists and turns to keep you eagerly turning the pages.  I am in awe of author Gillian Flynn's clever plotting and now anxious to read her two previous books.  To go more deeply into the story line would involve spoilers, so I will avoid that and just say Amy and Nick are two of the most dysfunctional, psychotic people you may ever come across.  Their story is riveting, appalling, and highly readable.

Not the tiniest of them all, but still small enough to create massive line ups. After a 30 min wait, our party of 4 was seated at the bar. Pretty cool - we get to watch them make our food! I ordered the Toroniku Ramen (pork cheek). All the toppings came separately which was good, because then you could heat them with your soup whenever you're ready to munch on those badasses. I'm not sure if they expected us to eat all the toppings, but they gave me a LOT of green onions. I like green onions so that was alright with me! Anyways, the pork cheek was incredibly soft and I recommend this to everyone who comes here. They give you quite a few pieces too, so that's a plus! Everything else was kinda meh.

They were good, but they were tiny. 10 was not enough for the 4 of us.I must mention - this place is relatively expensive. I believe I walked out with $20 less in my pocket. That's pretty expensive for ramen and a shared plate of gyoza. Well, I had my shot at pork cheek so the experience was satisfactory for me. I don't know if I'll come back because everything else other than the pork cheek was just ok. Maybe when the price is less steep! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: It is about a woman named Aileen Wuornos who was a prostitue , and winds up committing several murders\n",
      "Corresponding question: What is story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: When you think about a movie that is based on a serial killer, you could think &quot;how ordinary and overdone&quot;. It is about a woman named  Aileen Wuornos who was a prostitue, and winds up committing several murders (note that I did not refer to her as a serial killer). What makes this story different though, is the road that takes her there. This movie illicited a response from me that I had not expected which was a tremendous amount of sympathy and pity. Her life started out incredibly difficult, and only got worse. Unlike the other notables (John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, et al) in my opinion she was not crazy and was more or less driven to do what she did. The first murder that she committed was a &quot;John&quot; that was brutally raping her, and had planned on killing her. That was the one that opened the flood gates of rage. The rest were the product of a lifetime of abuse from, and hatred of all of the other &quot;Johns&quot; previous. Only one that I saw could be considered oppertunistic, and towards the end she actually has difficulty killing one of her last victims. If you had never heard of Aileen Wuornos before, this one will make you never forget her name.Along those same lines, Charlize Theron's performance was easily the best in her career, and she will likely be immortalized for her protrayal - and rightly so. While normally a incredibly beautiful bombshell, she had to gain thirty pounds, and go through an amazing transformation with only make up. The only prosthetics were used were fake teeth. She winds up looking nothing like herself, which makes it very easy to forget that it's really her.Coming from a guy who owns more than 500 titles, I consider this to be one of the best that I own. If you want a supplement to this movie, also check out &quot;Aileen: Life and death of a serial killer&quot; which is a biography done by HBO and helps to answer several questions as well as fill in some blanks.

Luckily they didnt make us wait at the end of the line and said next table wold be ours. Which took about 15mins or so. Once seated I went with the pancakes , I'm not a fan or ricotta or cooked fruits at all. But... these pancakes were amazzzzing. The lemon flavour in the ricotta was just perfect w the bluberries. I didnt even need syrup on my pancakes as the flavour was just perfect. My partner just got the reg ol eggs toast potatoes and substituted his meat for a fruit salad that i ate. Hes not into fruits and only other substitute was pork items which we dnt eat and salad. One of the negatives is  if you dont eat pork theres no alternatives, no turkey bacon and even the beans hve pork in it which was a disappointment.

      "Corresponding review: I stayed at the historic (it is over 100 yrs old) Drisco Hotel in a King bed-room in early July. It is located near some of the steepest hills, a stone's throw from the Presidio. Some rooms have a good view of SF Bay, which you can see from the street.True to what others have said, it is truly a great hotel. Staff at the reception were very polite, knowledgeable and helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations and advice about places to visit. They knew my name after I checked in. Use of the gym and pool in the Presidio is provided. Hotel staff were always friendly and greeted you whenever they see you. The only complaint I might have is that the maid was a little over-zealous and kept knocking on my door to see if I'm still in my room in the mornings, even when the check-out time was noon.My king bed room was cozy and fairly spacious (given the small size of the hotel) with high-speed internet connection (no WiFi), fridge, closet and TV. The bathroom was immaculate, with many quality amenities. Drisco stocks extra snacks and personl grooming items for purchase it the rooms. There was no air-conditioning but it is cool at night and I never needed it. I would strongly recommend using the free SF greeters pprogeam (guides who are residents of SF. They love to show you around their city and answering any questions, showing you areas of interest etc. I enjoyed my tour of Chinatown and various bus rides to see the neighborhoods of SF. The free breakfast was plentiful and excellent (eggs, ham/turket, yogurt, juice, cooked oats, cereal, toasts and bagels) and there was even an evening wine tasting with snacks.There weren't too many restaurants around the hotel (although Eliza's, 3 blocks away was excellent), so I'd rent a car if I'm staying here.

As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a \"HUGE\" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called \"Serenity\" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Excellent meal replacement bar.I really really really enjoyed the cherry cashew date nut bar.  I merely liked the blueberry bar.  It has no chocolate (thank god!  I've always hated granola bars and protein bars and all the rest that have a coating of awful chocolate on it) but lots of fruit and a healthy sweetness (not artificial, just good, if a little on the sweet side for my taste).  I would buy the blueberry bar again if I get tired of the cherry cashew, or to swap it out a bit, but not because I particularly like it.You *will not* be hungry until your next meal after you eat this bar.  And it's a lot healthier than most other bars out there.Note: if you do not like the taste or texture of dates, DO NOT buy this bar.Also note: I really hate most protein bars, granola bars (except quaker and nature valley), clif bars, odwalla bars, luna bars, zone bars, etc.  None of those really taste good.

When he discovered we had three individuals staying in the room (two queen beds) he proceeded to kick us out of the hotel, which should have been our first sign to leave. After some persuasion, he let us pay an EXTRA amount to stay the night. That night, our brand new Honda Civic's windows were smashed in and many possessions were stolen, including a Playstation portable with numerous games and DVD's, five-hundred dollars cash, cases of hand-selected wine from Sonoma county--the list goes on and on. We were never instructed that the parking garage was a dangerous area full of vagrants lurking in every corner as soon as the sun goes down. The next morning there were numerous persons sleeping in the parking garage. The room was filthy! The mattress was blood-stained and the bathroom looked as though it had never been cleaned.

      "Corresponding review: I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.

Portion sizes are absolutely perfect - generous but not so big you have to leave food on the plate. Their use of spices is impeccable, balanced and flavourful (and with varying degrees of heat for you to choose) - it truly does not get any better than this.- Their pad thai is excellent and properly made with the right ingredients (tamarind, pickled radish, etc - not ketchup or hot sauce).- Their curries are the best I've ever had in my life - the green curry with fish is light and refreshing; the panang beef curry is creamy and rich. Even the accompanying plain steamed rice is tasty. - Their salads are a lighter summer option, consisting of stir-fried ground meat with spices, served with steamed rice, that you can make into little burritos with the giant lettuce leaves.The Ambiance/Service: Very neat little basement-type restaurant, amazing relaxing decor, with wooden tables and fun colourful decorations. It transports you to another place - you could easily be on a tropical island rather than in the downtown core. The service has been consistently good, their servers being generally helpful with respect to the food. Pai is in a league of its own in terms of good Toronto restaurants.

Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much. This is perfectly adequate and for $104 on amazon, a no brainer. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.

Free parking is unheard of in frisco but this place has...free parking!\\nWe parked our car and walked everywhere, we did Uber a lot too but its very inexpensive since most drives were less than 10 minutes from any where in the city.

      "Corresponding review: This is a very nice addition to the Canon EF line-up.  Since my DSLR has an APS-C sensor, I needed a lens that would get me close to 50mm.  A cropped sensor makes this 40mm lens the equivalent of a 56mm.  I like the fact that the lens is very compact and light weight.  The optics are \"Can-tastic\".  The focus is great in auto mode or in manual and I very much like the option of switching back and forth.  I also purchased the Canon UV filter and the Canon lens hood.  The Canon 40mm f/2.8 STM has a very snug fit, but is easily and quickly swapped.  I have only had use of the lens for a week and have posted my very first photograph to this web page where other reviewers have posted sample photos.  I feel like this will be my \"go to\" lens for indoor family events like Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I am also planning to use it for a maternity shoot.  For the focal length and the money, this Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 is a great value.  No regrets. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

When I was offered an opportunity to review this similar product, I was skeptical that anything could top my favorite granola.

The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.  It's a bit more expensive than Bear Naked, but if both were on the same shelf, I would definitely reach for the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters.

      "Human answer: bedroom area cramped sitting\n",
      "Corresponding question: How much does a room with a spacious lobby cost?\n",
      "Corresponding review: We stayed at the Clift for three nights this summer (July 23 - 26, 2004). My wife and I had often stayed at the old Clift Hotel before it was taken over and renovated by the Ian Schrager group. The old Clift may have been showing its age, but it had spacious, elegantly furnished rooms in a convenient part of town. What a disappointment it was to see what has been done to this once great hotel ! We booked an Studio Jr. Suite which was described as an &quot;L&quot; shaped room. We quickly discovered that this was one of the former spacious rooms from the old Clift that we remembered so fondly, but it had been chopped up into two rooms ... creating a window-less bedroom area and very cramped sitting area. The decor makes abundant use of petroleum based synthetic materials (think plastic draperies, plastic night stands &amp; tables, plastic covered furnitiure) and has most opposing walls covered floor to ceiling with tinted mirrors. The mirrors tend to give the room a subtle feeling of nausea and the hard bench type furniture was uncomfortable. The bedding was of good quality but they must have contracted with a lumber company for the mattresses. My wife was particularly disappointed in the bathroom. It was cramped, with barely enough room for one person to turn around. There was no counter space and even the tub was scaled down to fit in such a small space. The old Clift had spacious, well appointed, marble bathrooms.The lobby and public areas have very dim lighting, which seemed stylish and attractive at first, but then became annoying. The elevator compartment was so darkened you could not even see the person standing next to you.They have even ruined the famous Redwood Room Bar. All of the warmth and intimacy of the old Redwood Room is missing, replaced by garish lighting and hard, uninviting bench type seats. The hostess greeted us at entrace with &quot;Oh .. are you here to inquire about reservations?&quot;. Acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what has been done to the ambiance, I was almost in tears.Unless you are attacted to dark spaces and synthetic materials, I would give this hotel a pass. We certainly will not be back. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Warning! This review is written differently then all my other reviews. It does contain spoilers throughout, but you will get a warning once spoilers will begin.The third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy - Mockingjay has been one of the most anticipated books of fans of this much loved series. The first two books - The Hunger Games and Catching Fire - told a story rich in characters we all fell in love with and rooted for from beginning to end. With the release of Mockingjay readers were more then excited to find out the conclusion to this epic tale.Giving Mockingjay the 4 stars that I did was in fact a hard choice to make. Writing this review is tough. I thought giving myself a few days or longer might clear away the questions I had to make writing this easier, which needless to say didn't work out as planned. I usually don't write a review with spoilers, nor do I write reviews where I talk things out at such length, but it needed to be done and this time there's just no way around it. So, please know that from this point on I will be addressing key points that will give things away - so be warned there will be SOME spoilers laced throughout!****Spoiler Alert****First, I have to say that I read half of this book with my breath held and the other half with a kind of, the only way I can explain it was that I was lost. The characters felt so different from where we left them in Catching Fire that at times it was hard to recognize them from the previous two books.Katniss didn't seem like her normal fighting self. And I often wondered if that was because she questioned Coin and if she even wondered if things would be different with Coin as president. In the beginning of the book when they are trying to talk Katniss into being the Mockingjay there was a conversation with Coin that made me believe she felt she not only didn't have much of a choice in the matter but that she questioned just what Coin's true motives are behind everything. Is this why Katniss wasn't her normal fighting self? Was she just tired of running a race in a never ending up hill battle where she then believed no matter what she did the way of the world would never change? Or did she believe there was nothing she, just one teenage girl could really do to make positive changes in the world of Panem? Or was it the fact that she was pretty much injured throughout the whole book?The lack of Peeta was also hard and what little interaction these two had I enjoyed more so then I did with her and Gale. I found Gale to be more then lost within Mockingjay, and found how easily he went from the hunter, gather and provider to uncaring and cold soldier a bit too easily. I mean everything with the mountain and his answer to how to take it down was more then callous and shocking to say the least. However the flip side is, Panem is a rough place to live and was Gale finally pushed over the edge too? Still, either way you look at this, it just didn't feel like \"Gale\" to me. Sad but true.The ending was shocking. I felt it was rushed by many pages and left more holes in it then Swiss cheese. I mean, Gale is a HUGE character and to leave his story so open ended was wrong and extremely harsh. There was no closure with Gale - he's there one page and gone the next. I felt that Katniss's mother was selfish on so many levels. I understand all that her mother has gone through from before the beginning of book one, however Katniss has suffered through SO much for her whole family and all the people within Panem and her mother can't take a trip back to their home to make sure if her now only daughter is alright? That just didn't sit well with me and actually made me frustrated. I mean common! Look at all Katniss did and all she survived for the love of her family! And yes, I know Peeta and Haymitch had more of a hand in keeping Katniss alive then I'm giving credit here, however I'm really talking about how her relationship with her mother was within those last few pages of this book.These were the main aspects of the book that I didn't agree with or understand. However, I did give Mockingjay 4 stars and now that I worked through all the negativity and got that out of the way, I believe that in all reviews, the ending should focus on the good and that's just what I plan to do here.Peeta being tortured was a given, this wasn't a good thing, but... let me explain - anyone who reads Mockingjay will know its coming. However the degree to which this is done is not only epic but fit with the one character that I felt never changed - and that was Snow.Everything that was shocking to me in this whole series is what I found as part of the best of the best. Peeta being tortured and just how he was tortured was not only a key part in his story as mentioned above, it was so true to Snow that anything less then this just would have been far off course for this ruthless character. The struggles in Peeta because of just how he was tortured, and then within his relationship with Katniss - it opened up and showed a different side to the two. I might not have liked what I saw, but if you think back to their relationship throughout the whole trilogy this was just another uphill battle they are forced to climb to figure out what their relationship meant to each other.The story did give me many conclusions and endings to main and subplots. Where there might have been some holes, however there were answers and endings - both good and bad. The good surpassed the bad. The wedding between Finnick and Annie gave hope to everyone that was much needed throughout all of Panem. The little bits of strength that Katniss gains from Finnick were nuggets of gold within the pages of Mockingjay. Finnick, while suffering alone was able to rise above everything to be there for Katniss when she needed to be pulled up and out of the haze I often found her in.Collins writing was there shining through again in Mockingjay, and while I didn't agree with many parts of this conclusion, sometimes a clear happy ending just isn't in the cards and that alone is sometimes need and often is refreshing in books. In each of the three titles there had to be bad to get through to the good and it's the same with Mockingjay.I recently read something about how people are upset with the Epilogue and I can see where some would feel it was forced and some might find it a cop out. Yet I've read it a couple of times and I go back and forth on this one. Today I see how wonderful it is. For me, it shows that all Katniss struggled for wasn't lost. That in the end she won. Peeta won and that in the end they both found just want they needed in the world and each other. That nothing is perfect and everything isn't easy and sometimes you have to struggle to get to the good in life.All in all, Collins has written another book that many will be thinking and talking about for a long time to come. With the end of any much beloved trilogy or series there's always a chance people will be upset because of how things ended and without a doubt there might be people not pleased by various things in this book. There might be things I didn't agree with, nor understand; however, in the end, I do have to say that the good outweighed the bad. I'll be suggesting these books for a long time to come to other fellow readers and I'll look forward to rereading each of these books numerous times. I'm more then looking forward to seeing just what Collins writes next. Enjoy.For more info and reviews please visit my Book Review Blog here - [...] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup. In fact I found it so good that I would likely drink it on a regular basis. It is just perfect for me. Amazon's price is good as well. I'm kind of surprising myself by saying there's nothing not to like about this one. Give it a try! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: The cinematography is stunning\n",
      "Corresponding question: Do you like cinematography?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is one of the most interesting Hollywood films I have seen in a long time.  The plot revolves around a young man and a new friend with whom he starts up a fighting club for men.  However, contrary to the previews as  shown in theaters, the film is about a lot more than just a bunch of guys  fighting.  It explores some very troubling themes--the shadow, consumerism  and its deflection of our spiritual drives, alienation and lonliness in  urban culture, the repression of our basic instincts--just to name a few.The cinematography is stunning and uses a techique employed by the  character Tyler Durden in the film:  Tyler, in his job as a theater  projectionist, splices pornographic one-frame shots into the films he runs.  Watch Fight Club closely--there are two places where a fleeting shot  appears, once about 15 minutes into the film, another at the very end.  This end shot undercuts the rather schmaltzy Hollywood closing image in a  sarcastically humorous way.And that's another great aspect of this  film--the anti-social humor, which will not appeal to all tastes, but which  is brilliantly carried off.  Just seeing Brad Pitt in his filthy bathrobe  with the appliqued coffee cups all over it is funny.Pitt's acting is wonderful, so is Ed Norton's.....and the two  of them together make a synergy which is very powerful.  Helena Bonham  Carter does a great job as Marla, the love interest whose vulgarity comes  off as an almost endearing quality.I have never really liked Hollywood  films much, finding them too defensive of the status quo.  However, this  film is in an altogether different league.  It is daring, provocative, and  very funny. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord Somalia\n",
      "Corresponding question: How much real was the film?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This film is based on a real life event so that it is difficult to review. One can find that the events portrayed and the way that they are portrayed can become more important than the actual impact of the film as an entertainment.The reality of the operation portrayed by the film was that the United States sent some peace keeping troops to Somalia, a country which had broken down to endemic civil war and had virtually ceased to function. The United States forces formed the view that this problem would be solved if some of the more major war lords were taken out of the equation. This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord in Somalia General Adid. The plan of the operation was to drop some highly trained troops by helicopter around a building. They were to arrest the war lord and then a convoy of vehicles was to remove him to the United States base. The operation went horribly wrong with two helicopters being shot down and the road convey getting lost. As a result a number of American soliders were killed and their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets by the Somalis. Other troops held out and were rescued by a force of Malaysians the next morning. The operation like any real life situation contained confused elements. On one hand there was the bravery of the soldiers on the ground, both the United States soldiers who went through hell and also that of the Somalis. Whilst the individual soldiers and pilots acted generally in a way that was beyond what could reasonably be expected of them the planning of the operation and the concept behind it was deeply flawed.The film caters mainly to an American audience and for that reason it works to show the bravery of the American's involved. There can be no argument with this as they surely were. However the film tends to oversimplify the conflict by demonising the Somalis and by not looking at the sheer stupidity of what those soldiers had to go through. The reality is that the various deaths were for nothing as the United States forces were quickly pulled out. There are some minor reconstructions of history to downplay the role of the Malaysians and to suggest that the Americans had a greater role in the rescue than they in fact had.If we leave aside these minor historical quibbles the film is surprisingly effective. It conveys a complex series of battles in a way that is clear and lets the viewer understand what is happening. The portrayal of the actual fighting is also reasonably accurate. (Apart from what is said above some scences featuring Eric Banna are also made up)The film is also quite long, yet it passes quickly and one does not really have a sense of the time one is viewing it. One of Ridley Scott's better outings in a while. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: First off this is a great little gadget. I bought the Roku 2XS and heavily considered the Apple TV before this one (I have an Iphone and Ipad). I ended up returning the Roku, not ordering the Apple TV and keeping this one. Why? Please read along.FYI, you can jump right into the PROS and CONS if you don't want to see my rationale and comparison of WD to Roku and AppleTVMy decision on buying and keeping the WD was heavily influenced by its claim (and now after trying it for a month, I declare it \"truth\") that it plays any format of video you throw at it. It does. AVI, MKV, MP4, MPEG, anything. You throw it in, it plays to perfection. On comparison, AppleTV barely plays anything non-Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats. Other than every other MKV it played NOTHING. Deal breaker.If your main or primary goal is streaming I would suggest the Roku over the WD. Especially if you have Amazon Prime (not supported by WD). It is sleeker, has a much more elegant remote and a smaller box.Coming back the WD: The main function, streaming, works flawlessly in HD setting (at my internet speed of 20MBPs download, 3MBPS upload). Navigation menu is easy to navigate and is well laid out. Not as good as Roku,I might add.Overall it is good but not great and a quick recap as to why is below in the PROS and CONSPROS+ Plays ANYTHING you throw at it via USB+ HD playback is excellent+ You can skip to \"desired time\" as opposed to going with the 2X to 16X forward speed. Sounds trivial but is very helpful when tried+ Has a free remote APP you can download from the APP store (don't know about Android)CONS- No Amazon Prime (I don't get this. Understand AppleTV not offering it but why WD, why?)- Terrible remote like the 1980's VHS player remotes) . You need to push the keys really harr and have close to perfect line of sight to the box- Netflix app asks you to confirm your account every other day. Annoying. Needs an update to fix this.Finally, which player is better fit for who:- WD : If you have multiple formats of videos to watch on your TV and use Netflix, hulu, hulu+ or vudu (plus pandora and a few other music stations) this is for you- Roku : If you want to watch all the mainstream streaming services and Amazon Prime and not care for USB video playback of various video formats, this is for you- AppleTV: If you want to remain in the Apple universe, have an extremely slick gadget (and remote), have the ability to mirror your IPAD or IPhone on your HDTV, and you don't care for Amazon Prime then this is for youOverall, I am very happy with my purchase despite it comes with a remote, that at first look wants you wonder what the heck they were thinking.

      "Corresponding question: How is the restaurant?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Miku is a known Japanese restaurant from Vancouver with lots of good praises from Vancouver, so when they opened their Toronto store, I told myself I HAVE to come here!Booking was easy as they are on OpenTable, but just remember when you book, you are booking the Toronto and not Vancouver location (they have different websites!).  Including myself with 4 other friends, we made a booking for Friday at 730pm.  As we walked in, we had people immediately greeting us, offering coat checks and quickly seated at our booth table.  First impression, decoration is very modern, upscale, bright and beautiful.  Our booth seats were very intimate and comfortable.After browsing through the menu, we ordered:Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus, Pan Seared Scallops, AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, all three Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba), Miku Roll, Miku Signature Sushi Selection, Green Tea Opera and Fuji Apple Tatin.  We also ordered Gold Omachi and Nakano Ume Sake!Appetizers (good for 4 people per order):The Octopus from the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus appetizer was grilled to perfection, the tentacles were very tender and easy to chew. The other ingredients blended in well with the octopus.  The Pan Seared Scallops on the other hand, although beautifully displayed and large, the taste lacks a little flavour.Entree (Good for 6 people):AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib (10oz) was a lot larger than expected, it comes auto medium rare which was perfect for me.  Prime Rib was juicy and the sauce was great.  The side baked potatoes and mushrooms were also equally as impressive!  I highly recommend.Sushi:Out of all the three Aburi Oshi Sushi, I highly recommend the Saba and Salmon as both had great amount of oil from the blowtorching and the sauce pairing were tremendous!  I recommend eating the Salmon before the Saba as the latter has a much stronger flavour that will overshadow the salmon.Mike Roll was decent, but was not superbly impressive, still worth a try if you are feeling for rolls with Uni (Sea urchin) and don't actually taste it much.  In terms of the Nigiri we got from the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, I though the Nigiri was the weakest link in terms of their sushi lineup.  The fish was just normal as it didn't give me the wow moment compare to my first bite on the Abrui Oshi Sushi.Desserts:Out of the two we ordered, I preferred the Green Tea Opera more.  It comes with a VERY strong matcha (green tea) ice cream with match cake on the side.  Both were very delicious and 5 of us did fight for this dessert more than the Fuji Apple Tatin.Sake:Large selection of Sake, but they were EXPENSIVE and tasted good!  The Ume Sake was a little too fruity and sweet for me (plum sake) so I preferred the Gold Omachi more (suited for warm drinking sake style).  The Gold Omachi was VERY smooth and I really enjoyed it.Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner experience on Friday.  I would give this 4.5 if yelp allows, but since it can't and I have to pick between a 4 or 5, I had to give this restaurant a 4.  The 1 missing start is because this restaurant was a bit weak on the Nigiri sushi we had, and I think for a Japanese restaurant, Nigiri is and should be one of their better items on the menu.  Having said that, I will definitely come here again for another meal!! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I saw the 5D come out and didn't see a need to \"upgrade\" to it. But the new 40D is just something else. I have it about 5 days now and I'm like a child at Christmas.There is just so much to praise about this camera - large LCD screen which is very clear, faster focusing, especially when using centre focus point, larger burst rate - ok, this has now caused me no end of problems, like firing off a burst of 20 images when I really only needed 3, and filling my memory card in no time.This camera is well worth it's price. It's a brilliant step between the 400D and the 1D. I don't have the need (nor money) for the 1D Mk III. This new 40D is just what I need.My first day of shooting with it was at a horse racing event. I was between two other photographers - one using a 30D and the other using a 1D. I felt like mine was capturing just what I wanted and in brilliant clarity. Ok, not the same fps as the 1D, but my friend with his 30D kept looking at me and laughing - it was because he would get 2-3 shots and I was taking about 20.For anyone thinking of this camera - try it out.

Some of the sites are very slow to load. I was on the fence between Fire HD 7 and Galaxy Tab 2 7 with the choice went to Fire HD. The main reason for me was HDMI although I would also like micro SD support.Web surfing is better but still no comparison to my desktop.The screen is significantly better than the original Fire. Colors are more accurate and the dynamic range is much much larger. Pictures are now more natural looking with a gradual transition from dark to bright, much closer to my calibrated monitor.I am not bothered by the ads, actually not sure where the ads are. No access to Google play is not a big deal for me. I only have a few apps loaded and that's all I need.Finally, I decided to stay with 7\" size. I just can't see to need to use a 10\" tablet. 7\" is just about right for carrying around and big enough to properly display everything I need. If I need larger display, I have multiple monitors and TVs to do that.Edit: May 12 2013 updateThe rating was changed from 4 stars to now 5 stars because of the two following findings1.

It's not as much green tea as it is mango and pineapple. If you're a tea lover, you might not like this so much. It's very fruity.  I like the fact that it's not all artificially sweetened even though it does contain an artificial sweetener.  At least there is some honey in it.  I would definitely buy these.

The clip is pretty useless, and the pouch is really small.The sound is decent.  Not great.  It's a little tinny and lacks any real base, but everything is audible and there isn't a lot of noticeable distortion.I purchased these to replace a pair of Shure isolating ear buds.  Let's be real.  They are a cheap replacement.  The audio quality is no where near the Shure set.  They do well at work and the gym but I won't brag about them.  Nor will I harp on the audio.  Also, when I put this set through the dryer, I wont be so angry with myself.If you want the best audio out there, ridiculous comfort and amazing isolation, pay more and get more.

Our server had great recommendations for popular items on the menu and was very friendly. The atmosphere is candlelit and dim, good for dates!ORGANIC HOUSE LABNEH (5/5)(Fennel + Honey + Olive Oil + Barbari Bread)Tasted like a very yummy humus haha! It's soo delicious! The bread was covered with different types of sesame seeds so eating the bread itself was already very tasty. Adding the labneh was a plus! Loved it!EGGPLANT KIBBEH (4/5)(Zucchini Flower + Baharat + Chickpea Batter + House Yogurt)I was super excited to try this crispy eggplant again but I realized they cooked it differently from how they did before. I'd prefer the crispy eggplant than this way of cooking. Both are still good.WAGYU LAHMEH PIDE (5/5)(House Turkish Paste + Fior De Latte + Toum + Basil Cress)How can flat bread taste so good?! I'd order this again and again. The wagyu paste was delicious and the bread itself was very chewy. This dish wasn't dry at all because a lot of cheese was drenched on top of the bread. The smell makes you even more hungry.GRILLED WHOLE BRANZINO (5/5)(Chermoula + Saffron Toum + Watercress)We came back for more of this!! I told my friends to order this dish at Byblos and all their reactions were like..Fish..?! Yes! Fish! They make it so good! The fish meat is drenched with flavour and the best part of this is.. It's boneless! DESSERTS:LOUKOUMADES (5/5)(Attiki Honey + Walnut Praline + Burnt Honey Ice Cream + Halva)Tasted like chewy donuts dipped with honey glaze. It tastes really really good - especially the burnt honey ice cream! I suggest eating each of these little bits separately first. Each one has its own flavour. Once mixed together, it creates another type of texture!PIZZELLE (3/5)(Baklava Ice Cream + Salted Caramel + Cous Cous Praline)The Baklava ice cream was amazinggg!

      "Corresponding review: If you're looking for the action, it's probably here. During our stay, we did see a couple bands coming, going, and chilling. We were there three nights. Two of those nights, the restaurant and bar were closed -- we knew that in advance. What we didn't know was that they'd be closed the third night, too, to host a private party. It worked out okay -- the desk staff gave us good advice as to where we could walk from there to get dinner. But not as convenient as having things on-site.The rooms were pretty basic, but with some fun frills thrown in for those in-the-know, like Spin and Filter magazines on the nightstand. The pool area was a good place to lounge about, but I'm not sure it ever gets very sunny there. The hotel was fairly quiet at night, which is quite a feat, considering the parties that were going on.This hotel is not for everyone. The breakfast and coffee are so-so, and there aren't too many little niceties that you might expect to find in a &quot;boutique hotel.&quot; Also, it IS in the Tenderloin district -- not the most comfortable place for non-urbanites, I'm guessing. (You'll find lots of drunks and junkies lying about if you walk around the area, especially at night. There was nothing that scared us, but I realize that just seeing this kind of thing is pretty scary to some people.) We had a good time, though -- especially my teenage daughter, who loved the place. I liked it that it was within a long-ish walk to all the major &quot;attractions&quot; -- Union Square, Chinatown, etc. Also it's just a few blocks from a BART station, if you like to take that route. For our needs - a clean, comfortable place with a bit of fun and &quot;something different&quot; thrown in - it was just the ticket. We will return soon. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We stayed at this hotel the first week of August. We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is great. It is a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf, the F Line, Pier 39 etc but is far enough away away from the &quot;ticky tacky&quot; areas. The hotel was clean and decorated nicely. The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so. The linens and bed were comfortable. The shower head was stong and the water was nice and warm.On the first part of our stay, we were in a courtyard room. This made the room seem a bit larger by the way that it was set up. When we returned later in the week we were put in an outside room. It was noisier and even with the shutters closed the light from the Safeway sign kept the room pretty bright. I work night shift and am used to sleeping during the daylight, but for people who like it dark, that might be more difficult. The second room also smelled a bit musty (think mothballs) and we could never get it aired out. Only a mild inconvenience though.The am coffee/tea/biscotti is nice. It was a nice stop before heading out for a bigger breakfast. Only participated in the evening reception once. The wine was good, but the appetizers were gone. Lots of people take advantage of this time, it was always busy.We did eat at the hotel restaurant for one breakfast. The food was ok...and the service was just ok too. Nothing to write home about for the price. Next time I would probably go somewhere else.The front desk staff recommended &quot;Fior d'Italia&quot; for a dinner reservation. It was a 2 block walk and SO great!! It was a wonderful suggestion. We also enjoyed &quot;The Stinking Rose&quot; on another afternoon.The Tuscan Inn is a great hotel and we would return again.

If you are like me and love a good romance novel then stop reading reviews and just buy it right now because you won't be disappointed.PROS- Great character development. I could mentally imagine every single character and fell in love with some of them, could relate to some of their problems and literally cried when they cried at times.- Good story line. There was drama when there needed to be. There were comical moments, many sad moments and some very happy times as well. The story developed into something that really touched my heart. Dealing with death is not something to easily write about, however, Young elaborates on it beautifully and shows how to deal with and get over the loss of a loved one.- Heated romance. Need I say more?CONS- The only two bad things that I can really say about the book is that first of all, it was somewhat predictable. The hinted foreshadowing is far from subtle. Although there were a few moments in the book that I was actually caught by surprise and wasn't expecting it to happen.- Secondly, there were a lot of similarities between this book and the Fifty Shades series. Both had characters that were really mentally messed up. Both have the main male character being drop dead sexy, rich businessmen that are very protective over the women they love, and have also been through terrible tragedy. Both main male characters also get into bar fights. However, as I got deeper and deeper into the book, I was finding more and more differences between them where I was able to mentally separate them, but in a good way. Now that I have read the entire book, I can say that although it does share some characteristics with Fifty Shades of Grey, On Dublin Street differentiates enough from it to make it unique and a very very good read.In my opinion, it would make an excellent movie that would really teach an important life lesson.

      "Corresponding review: Bridge cameras are a quirky lot: they're essentially a point-and-shoot camera with DSLR-like features.  For the HS50EXR, the phrase &#34;DSLR-like&#34; sums it up almost entirely.There are many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere that touch on the HS50's main features, so I won't go into those beyond saying that the manual zoom is great and the image quality (which has been spoken poorly about in some cases) is actually quite good.  This review is intended to hit on features that might not get immediate consideration when you're looking for a bridge camera.I purchased the HS50EXR as a backup to my DSLR, something that would be easy to carry and that my wife (who is not a photographer) could use and get good results.  Also, I needed something with strong video capabilities that would auto-focus well.  This camera delivers in spades.  It's fantastic, full-featured, and easy for my wife to use but with enough control to give experienced photographers plenty to play with.A few points that don't get much press about this camera:Focus Ring: This camera features manual focus via a free-spinning focus ring behind the zoom ring.  The focus control is strictly electronic, but the focus ring has a quick, responsive, and organic feel to it.  Obviously, for video work you'd want to be able to exert a bit more control over focus, but overall it's impressive.  In photo mode, there are focus highlights that appear on whatever the lens is focused on, a useful feature that the Magic Lantern crowd will recognize and appreciate.  Sadly, that same crowd will be sorely disappointed to find out this feature is not present in video mode.  Video mode will allow manual focus, of course, but without the handy focus peak highlights.Bayonet/58mm Lens: This camera includes a bayonet-style tulip lens hood (which was impressive to me), and also accepts 58mm lens accessories.  That was my big gripe about other bridge cameras; there was no way to provide the glass with any protection.  The HS50EXR lets you put a UV filter on the front, which is especially crucial considering you don't have the luxury of replacing a lens if it gets dinged up.Video Quality:  One of the best things about this camera is its video quality.  It is sharp, responsive, quick to focus, maintains focus easily, and there are a number of high-fps options for slow-motion video.  Of course, the faster the shutter goes, the lower your resolution gets, but if you're looking to capture something cool at a high frame rate, this will definitely do it.  One disappointment for video mode is that you are not allocated any control over exposure, so no aperture, shutter speed, etc that you would get on a DSLR.Articulated Screen:  This is great for videographers like myself who need to frame a shot while being in front of the lens.  Very handy.Q Button:  This is a great feature for the camera to have.  In true DSLR fashion, you have a dedicated screen to adjust ISO, white balance, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  Fantastic, easy to use, and handy.Now, there are a few things that I would have changed on this camera that keep it from getting a full 5 stars:Plastic Tripod Socket:  This camera is big and heavy, like a small DSLR.  The tripod socket is a heavy-duty hard plastic, but I would have much rather had something metal.Lack of Control in Video Mode:  I like that you can use manual focus in video mode, but other than that you get what the camera gives you, which is not exactly what I want.  Still, the video mode is great on its own.Sensor Size:  This is the biggest difference between the HS50EXR and a true DSLR.  Even an entry level DSLR will dwarf the 1/2&#34; sensor that this camera sports.  The HS50EXR's sensor is the most tangible throwback to its point-and-shoot roots, but don't write it off immediately.  While you'll never fool anyone into thinking your shots came from a DSLR, you'll be sure to get some excellent looking shots.  Even some camcorders at this price level have smaller sensors than this, so it's not as bad as people say it is.  In fact, I think considering its size, the images look amazing, but I would have liked to see Fuji use a bigger sensor to live up to the DSLR features and aesthetics.If you're looking for a good family camera that's a jack-of-all-trades that yields great results, this is what you're after.  If you're on the fence about this camera and a full-fledged DSLR, go with the DSLR.  I was glad I purchased a DSLR before purchasing this camera because it gave me a much better sense about what the HS50EXR can and can't do.  Once you understand its limitations and capabilities, you can really start making great images with this camera.  I definitely recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: First time to S.F. Booked Hotel online. Being a neat freak and a germaphobe :} and not knowing the area we picked a great hotel ! We would have paid double anywhere else as I''ve checked literally every accomodation. From the moment we stepped into the lobby the entire staff was warm , friendly and extremely helpful. From 1rts shift, 2nd shift and 3rd shift and the restaurant staff were exceptional. About 5-6 blocks from the Nob Hill shopping district.Close to bus, close to an array of eateries. Nice bar next door, one block to laundry mat. We walked to China Town and actually walked back from the Alcatraz Pier , Fishermans Wharf and past Lombard Street ( crooked ). It was a hike but the location is very convenient. We took a bus directly to the Cliff House roundtrip for $4.00. The staff has a Towncar on call to anywhere else you''d like to go.i.e Airport, The two excursion trips we took the tour bus picked us up and dropped us off at the Hotel. The room was vey nice. Nothing fancy but very clean and compfy. The daily maid service was great. Cannot beat the price compared to other hotels. We basically spent 6-8 hours a night in the room anyways. A few things may be outdated but not enough to deter us from staying here again. We also rented a car for the day that Gio , the desk clerk, arranged for us.$54.00 for the day with pick up and dropoff. We drove down highway 1 to Santa Cruz and Carmel. Very nice drive. Neighborhood was nothing to worry about. Hotel clientele was very professional . And they have wine tasting night almost nightly. Book this Hotel with no regrets. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I have to confess, up until I watched this DVD, my total appreciation of The Day the Earth Stood Still  consisted of my mom's idealistic teenage  Can't we all just get along?  memories of it, and the fact that the film and its star, Michael Rennie, made it into a line of the Rocky Horror theme song. (You remember, he told us where to stand, On our feet!). I didn't expect to get all that much out of it, but kept hearing my movie buff friends tout it as THE sci-fi classic of the early fifties. Well. Writer Nicolas Mayer, useful idiot though he may have been (Russia was trying to bring peace to the world, - he says in an accompanying documentary, referring to the time when Stalin was eating Ukrainians for breakfast, artists like Mayer for dinner, and throwing the leftovers in the Gulag, -and [the West] kept building bombs.), created a screenplay that transcended the political times. He says he employed a subtle Christ theme that he didn't expect anyone to notice. I noticed. It's precious.A guy from beyond our world, who takes on the name Carpenter,  and shows up in human form, comes to warn us that if all of us don't stop fighting....if we all don't learn to love each other that is... terrible destruction will befall us. But this message isn't for the select few who are full of self- importance. He insists the message is for everyone, although constantly he faces powers that try to stop him. Kids love him. He doesn't care very much about money. Sound familiar? I could go on, but reviews like that are called Spoilers.The direction and acting are superb. Shadow and light and camera direction are well-used to show how different the stranger seems to the others in the film, even though he looks like an ordinary human being to the viewer. The choice of an unknown was a brilliant means to ensure the interplanetary visitor was a stranger...unfortunately for Mr.Rennie, his career did so poorly he's a stranger for us, too. There are a few faux pas in scenery during a scene with Ms. Neal and the robot that could have been edited more carefully, hence the subtracted star.Extras: The documentary about the making of the film is interesting but drags on a bit.

      "Corresponding review: The Numi packaging and advertising is a little over the top, but that shouldn't take away from the tea. Pu'erh tea goes through a 60 day fermentation process, so it's not going to be a flowery fluffy desserty type of a tea.There are hints of cardamom in this, but just like theGinger Pu'erh Tea Bags, 16-CountI have a hard time finding spiciness in the flavor.The package contains 16 individually sealed non-GMO biodegradable tea bags. The outside container has a perforated area at the bottom, so if you gently press through the part on the front of the packaging, you get a nice re-closeable box for the tea bags. The package includes an expiration (\"Best Before End\") date.The inside flap includes a recipe. This one is for a jelly, the Ginger for iced tea. I opened the box using the perforation so I didn't even realize there was a recipe in the inside flap. A quarter-size sticky keeps the flap attached to the main box, so you don't even have to open it that way unless you want the recipe.Every tea bag has a small indentation, a hint as to where to tear it open. Each bag includes brewing instructions (3 to 5 minutes). But I was disappointed that each tea bag is attached to its string with a small staple. I am sure there are better ways of doing this without the need for staples!Being stingy, I can get two 8oz cups of tea from each tea bag. Obviously the first one is stronger but because this is a strong and dark tea, the second cup still looks dark. I steep the first time for 3 minutes (using a timer). Given its strength, this is good as iced tea as well.The package says that it has higher caffeine but it doesn't provide a number. I usually get a caffeine kick from coffee, but I did not get a kick from this one. Caffeine-wise, it felt like green tea. Some people claim that tea caffeine is slower to enter the bloodstream than coffee caffeine, and tea typically has less caffeine than coffee. This certainly explains my reaction to it but caffeine reaction varies, so it's hard to tell how it will affect others. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Anyways, I won't go into plot details, there's no need to......but anyways, this movie is beautiful.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and for that reason, it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.  I'm tired of stuffy, boring movies (The English Patient, or Il Postino, anyone?

Motel is very well kept, room was large by SF standards , lots of counter space in bathroom, good water pressure. Place seemed very secure , you have to use your room key to access elevators. Best of all parking is free in a enclosed parking lot, parking space is a premium in SF , with most hotels charging $35-45 dollars per day for parking. Heck we paid $30 to park at the ballgame and another $12 to go to the farmers market at the ferry building. As noted by other entries there are numerous places to eat within 2 square blocks of motel including Mels Diner ( of American Graffitti fame) right across the street. We had a 3rd floor king w/ city view , nice view however if you open the windows the noise from Lombard Street is very loud , once closed noise barley audiable.

      "Corresponding review: WOW...everything you would want in a thriller and one of the most timely books I have ever read. I have a degree in economics with graduate work and 25+ years on Wall Street. Brad Thor has told a great story and weaved into it the perils the country faces as the Federal Reserve (as \"Federal\" as Federal Express) is not at all \"Federal\" and has no \"Reserves\" and will fight for its existence. Did it have a time and place? Yes, surely. But it has no regulatory agency oversight, arrogantly refuses or deflects from direct questions at hearings, and for years has benefited from those tossing out \"Black Helicopter Loons\" to dismiss it's critics when it has been discussed.The Fed is a club. It was created in secret and it operates in secret (\"Hidden Order delves into this in detail) with no intentions at all of being transparent or being reigned in. Instead of fixing the systemic issues it brought about from the years of easy money by Greenspan, this stooge Bernanke, along with Turbo-Tax Timmy, bailed out all their powerful friends. But don't let Bush off the hook as Hank Paulson, via the Goldman Sachs revolving door into Fed and Treasury policy, diverted the TARP funds to pay premiums for pure junk to their pals, not the American people who are still hurting.It's a wonderful read and an informative read. Mr. Thor has been appearing on more shows than any author I have seen of late and this book should be a real eye-opener for those who thought we are on the right track because the train is speeding and barely holding the rails thanks to this clandestine group that tacks on more-and-more debt that even our grand children will be burdened by. The Fed needs to be stopped and this awareness Mr. Thor brings to the people in this thriller is a good start for the common man. I already have seen and fully understood the points in the book due to education and working on the street. Now the general public has an great read and an education to go with it. Thank you Mr. Thor. A job well done...kudosP.S. And on the day of its release Bernanke issued a statement: \"Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is what's needed in the U.S. economy.\" The stock market was looking vulnerable, interest rates were rising, and that affects profits. The club can't have that so the taxpayer funded bailouts will continue. The Fed MUST be audited and reigned in. And you'll understand why when you read this book! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How was the suite where your daughter stayed?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I was traveling to San Francisco with my parents and we booked Hotel Drisco based on the great reviews from Trip Advisor, making our reservation nearly two months before arriving in SF. When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms.The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly. We loved the private, neighborhood feel of Pacific Heights. There are some great nearby restaurants (try Sociale) and the buses run frequently if you're wanting to go further afield. There's also a complimentary town car service running to Union Square every morning between 7 and 9, which is handy. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The design is modern and simple, there is an excellent selection of tea and coffee and the minibar has low prices. The bathroom was just OK, nothing special. Staff: I really can't understand why everybody liked the staff. We found the front desk staff very impersonal and not courteous enough. I work in a deluxe hotel in Rome and know exactly how it should be, so I even get more angry when guests are not treated in the proper way because I know what are my rights and what I should expect. When we checked in the boy was not at all friendly. The following morning I called him to say that our sink was not working properly and he told me that it would be fixed in a few hours. When I returned back in the evening, of course nothing was done and nobody apologised. As I expected, the following day as well no action was taken. I did not complain further, as I only had to stay for 4 nights in total. Parking: it is really expensive in San Francisco. In this hotel we had to spend like 35 dollars per night, which is really not comparable to the good rate we had for the hotel. Anyway, you don't have any choice if you have your own car.Restaurant: service there is excellent, the staff is great and the food is good. After 2 weeks of fast food and Mexican food, we really had enough, so we wanted to try a few restaurants in San Francisco. We noticed that there were a lot of local clients, not staying at the hotel, which is always a good sign. Food was very good, price adequate.I would definitely return to this hotel, despite the front desk staff. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

You wouldn't be wasting a penny on the food or service.We had the sashimi lunch platter which had red tuna, salmon, yellow snapper, and scallop. It was fresh and tasted perfectly seasoned even without the soy sauce and wasabi. Which is what I feel sashimi should actually taste like.The Miku four dish spring set was made with seasonal food and had a variety of seared fish (tuna, red snapper), salad, and ingredients native to Japanese dishes. The dessert was amazing, perfectly balanced in sweetness and tartness. Would definitely come back when the sushi craving strikes! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am too old for this place; La Carnita is a Mexican-inspired modern/fusion restaurant.  I have no idea if the bathroom is accessible because I couldn't reach it.  Full disclosure; I went on a Saturday night with my BFF.  I don't normally go out to popular places on a Saturday because I hate busy places.  And THIS PLACE WAS SO BUSY!The food was delicious but NOT vegan friendly.  There are LOTS of vegetarian options, but I wouldn't bring a vegan because most of the non-meat dishes are covered in cheese.  My BFF and I ordered the nachos with salsa, cheese and guacamole.  It was VERY good!  In fact, everything we ordered was delicious.  I would have ordered more if I had had room in my belly.My ideal for this place would be if I could order food to go.  I can't deal with being squashed next to the person next to me, able to hear all of their conversation.  I like space and quiet.  This place has neither.  I would return here if La Carnita didn't have such problematic issues with social media.

      "Corresponding question: What is the quality of the blend?\n",
      "Corresponding review: For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything \"vanilla,\" I decided to tryStarbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). With this special blend, Starbucks promises \"a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma.\"I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say \"Thanks,\" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the \"subtleness\" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! \"Wow,\" I thought, \"this is real coffee!\" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review. I'm sitting here sniffing like a kid breathing in the aroma of a newly-baked cake. How's that for indulgence. :-)Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 10, 2010Author of \"Millennium Babe: The Prophecy,\" \"Dream Reachers\" (with Chase Von) and other books ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; is probably the most famous fantasy novel written in the last generation, but it doesn't deserve to be.  About the only thing that's going for this novel is the terrific ending, with a huge surprise waiting in the final line.  But to get there, you have to wade through about 650 pages of tripe, and that's in the hardcover edition.For most of the book, the plot is fairly straightforward.  There's a group of eight people who need to get from point A to point B, where point A is called The Two Rivers and point B is called Tar Valon.  Meanwhile, an archvillian known as The Dark One sends overwhelming sinister forces to stop them.  This portion of the book isn't developed with much skill, which is what makes it pretty boring.  All that the good guys have to do is swing their swords around a few times and they can easily defeat entire armies of bad guys.  One top of that, the good guys are led by an Aes Sedai (a female wizard) who can do more or less anything, so there's never any real sense of danger.  The action scenes also grow very repetitive.  For instance, there's one scene where our heroes are being chased by a horde of villians, but luckily they're able to run into a magic place where the bad guys just aren't willing to go.  This exact same scene gets repeated twice later in the novel.Many people seem to think that the characterizations are one of this novel's strengths, but I don't agree.  The main character is named Rand al'Thor, and the novel is supposed to show him changing from an ordinary farmboy into a great warrior.  The problem is that he doesn't act like an ordinary person at the start; none of the five characters who grew up in a small down do.  They all acts like soldiers right from the start.  They're willing to plunge into battle without any hesitation, and the children always act totally grown up.  I found the characters to be largely static and unbelievable.This certainly isn't a terrible novel.  As I mentioned, it does have a wonderful surprise ending.  Just don't expect to be swept away by it.  Also, be sure to read the gloassary at the end, which is more entertaining than most of the book. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: movie is just plain bad\n",
      "Human answer: The ship scenes are credible\n",
      "Corresponding question: How the director describe the scene?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This movie is just plain bad.  So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.A lot of work went into this movie.  When I went to see the film I brought a copy of PEARL HARBOR: THE MOVIE AND THE MOMENT to read while waiting for the film to begin.  After leafing through the book I expected much more from the film.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett fans will probably enjoy this film, but military history enthusiasts should snub it all together.

      "Corresponding review: Angelica PennettaMr. SlaterEnglish 910 December 2010The Girl With The Dragon TattooThe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was the type of book that took awhile to get into but in the end was worth the wait because of the \"on edge\" feeling you got throughout almost the whole book; I highly recommend that anyone who loves a good mystery reads this book.The plot was very intriguing; once you think you have it all figured out there is still the doubt that you are wrong and knowing this book you probably are. It seems as if every time you think Salander and Blomvist have the case solved, they find a new piece of evidence that puts a whole new twist on the story. The book starts out in detail about how Mikael Blomvist, a professional journalist, is being convicted for libel but then takes a sudden turn when he is asked by Henrik Vanger, a member of one of the wealthiest family's in Sweden, to help investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger. Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old rebellion who, let's just say, is a big fan of piercings, tattoos, and intense crime solving, eventually joins Blomvist in the search for Harriet. Step by step, as Salander and Blomvist continue their research they creep a little closer each day to finding out the truth about the Vanger family. As you get closer to the end, you'll find yourself getting ready to jump out of your skin; its one of those endings that slaps you right in the face. When it comes to the ending, you wont disappointed.The highly detailed characterization and conflict was what made this book such a fascinating thriller. When reading the description of Lisbeth Salander, not only does her striking appearance catch your attention but the way her personality is portrayed gives you the perfect imagery. It's not only the physical description of the characters that pulls you in, it's the way everything is played out and crafted so carefully. The conflict was the most important part of this book, in my opinion just because there was conflict after conflict that Salander and Blomvist then had to try and solve. This book is filled from beginning to end with a roller coaster of suspenseful conflict and thrill.Henrik Vanger searched for his niece for 40 years, when everyone gave up and he was all on his own, Blomvist and Salander were the only ones willing to help. By this act of generosity as portrayed in the book, I think the author was trying to make a point to the reader. The point trying to be made could have been anything from meaning do things happen for a reason to if you never give up you may be surprised at what you may find, either way it's a good read. Blomvist takes part in helping Salander find the real her, he helps her realize what she needs to do to be happy while at the same time trying to make everyone else happy.Overall, I loved this book! It was definitely the type of book that was constantly grabbing you and pulling you in; it had me jumping from page to page just to see what was going to happen next. If you're into mind boggling mysteries that make you think, this the book for you! It never stops making you wonder. I would definitely recommend reading this book, but I have to warn you, once you get started you can't stop!Work CitedStieg, Larsson.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

      "Corresponding review: As a South Asian-American I thought this book was authentic, one of the truest books I've ever read. The passages that get a bit longish for some readers seemed eerily like my own life--descriptions of things found in bedrooms, of Bengali-American parties, of people's coping strategies of being first- or second-generation American. I found that I could relate to at least two of the characters, and knew a lot of the types of the other characters from people in my own life. I wish I'd written this book.I give a lot of credit to Lahiri for producing a work that is so emotionally authentic, universal, and resonant, while solving the problem of the guilt sometimes passed around in a family. Lahiri does so without putting any of the blame for anybody's existential or cultural unhappiness on any one character. Everybody is likeable and their situations and impulses are understandable. Ashoke and Ashima are not to blame for Gogol's name, since he picks it himself in a way and he has a problem with being distanced from it. Ashoke is not to blame for Ashima's estrangement from her family and country, because they were living poor in Calcutta and Ashima didn't find a better suitor. Just like in real life, there's often no better option in a situation, just a choice someone made a long time ago with the given inputs. No one is a villain, she just tells it like it is.Also, Lahiri wrote a book about some pretty nice people that are accepting and turn out to be good for each other in the end. If I were writing the book I'd have a lot less of this because sometimes things don't always get patched up, but I'm glad Lahiri does it differently, since with bad Bengali neighbors or children who marry outside the group and cut off ties with their family or what have you, the novel would collapse under its own weight, since there's already death and estrangement to deal with.The Mira Nair movie was also right-on.

      "Corresponding review: I prefer loose teas. There is just a remarkable variety of teas available and in general their flavor is a bit more intense. But I also like the convenience of bag teas. This tea is a nice compromise. The 'pyramid' bags really do seem to help give a flavorful tea. They maintain their shape when put in hot water and you can visibly see more room, they act like a tea infuser.And the combination of flavors is very good. There is enough vanilla to smooth out the blackberry, the combo works well together. I personally would like some more blackberry taste, but these still quickly became one of my favorite bagged teas.

      "Corresponding review: We stayed there February 25th. Our first time and we definitely would return. Not a hotel for those who prefer the large chain, full service places. This is more like a small European hotel. Staff members were polite, friendly, knowledgeable and quick to address our needs. Rooms, while not large, are well appointed and VERY quiet. Both the gratis continental breakfast and evening wine/cheese events were perfect. Given that these are included in the room price, this hotel gives excellent value-for-money. The Inn is centrally located and that enabled us to walk easily to shopping areas, theaters and restaurants. The small alcoves at the ends of each floor, where both breakfast and wine/cheese are served are particularly nice because they encourage mingling among guests. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Viva Labs' coconut oil was my first venture into cooking with coconut oil.  It comes cold-pressed and has the consistency of hardened shortening. But, that is where the loose resemblance to shortening ends.  Viva Labs' coconut oil smells great, tastes great, and adds a hint of coconut/sweetness to whatever I cook.  I have also eaten teaspoons right out of the container & the coconut oil has a pure coconut flavor - a light flavor that is quite pleasing.Overall, the coconut oil does not leave my food greasy & the added, subtle flavor addition really enhances some of the meals that I cook - I've used this coconut oil with chicken, popcorn & oatmeal cookies.  Everything was quite tasty.I am almost finished with my container & coconut oil will stay on my shopping list now that I've discovered bow much I like it.**Disclaimer**Viva Labs sent me their product for review purposes.

The place was very busy, which explains some of the slowness of the service. But quite honestly, that's not why I'm giving this place 3/5 stars. I ordered the pad thai, and it was good! Thinking back however, I can't differentiate it between the pad thai I've eaten at Nana, or Sukho Thai, or even dare I say...Salad King! While I had been going through a Thai phase at the time, I truly believe that if a Thai place is amazing, it will come through in the pinnacle of Thai cuisines (to us Westerners anyway). So if the pad thai doesn't impress me, I may not be back.A tip: if you are looking for pad thai that is worth your while, go to Khao San Road. It's the only pad thai that has stood out to me in Toronto. I remember thinking that this would be the kind of thing you would find on the streets of Thailand!The atmosphere was okay, though other reviewers seem to like. It has a basement-y feel to it - very dim, and very loud with all the people. It is absolutely trendy and all that, but I like to be able to see my menu and my dinner partner.THE BOTTOM LINE: regular Thai food in a very loud, trendy-basement space. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the keyboard?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is a great keyboard.  I also own the original Airbender that I used with my iPad 2.  It was very good and I've been very happy with it, but I have to admit, this is a nice improvement.The overall look is much improved.  It is very clean and professional looking.  It is also somewhat ruggedized though I haven't tested the overall durability.  It is much lighter than the original keyboard and some of the competing keyboards that I checked out.  The weight is heavier than you might expect if you haven't used a keyboard before, but it is a nice complement to the iPad Air.  The overall design makes it very stable when using it on your lap.  The case is designed to allow you to rotate the iPad from landscape to portrait.  This is very convenient and also allows you to choose which direction you like the iPad's buttons to be on.The keyboard itself is surprisingly easy to type on. They keys are normal size and have normal spacing.  I can type on this keyboard as easily as I can my desktop keyboard.  The keys have good feedback.  There are also dedicated iOS keys for home and lock.  Additionally there are the extra keys necessary to work with OSX and Windows.The keyboard connects via Bluetooth.  It is very simple to pair it with the iPad.  While designed for iPad, it also works with iPhones and computers.The keyboard charges via micro-usb.  It does not take long to charge and the battery lasts a very long time.The new Airbender 2.0 also has a nice new design that allows the iPad stand to be removed from the keyboard and stand alone.  This allows you to set it up similar to a separate keyboard and monitor like you would have with your computer.  This feature actually works very well on a solid surface.Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the improvements in this keyboard.  The design is nice, the keyboard is very easy to type on, and it is very easy to use. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The flavor is absolutely delicious, but the texture of the flakes have the same rigidity and CRUNCH of the original \"Grape Nuts.\"  (Of course, \"Grape Nuts\" had no flavor except whatever cardboard flavor they managed to leech from the box they were in, but that's another story.)Basically, if somebody is talking to you while you're enjoying a mouthful of this cereal, you won't be able to hear them over the crunching - but you won't care much, because you'll be savoring the flavor and not paying attention to them anyway.

      "Corresponding review: This is without a doubt one of the best presented Paleo/SCD recipe books. The pictures are amazing, presentation is top-notch, the recipes are easy to follow, the writing is friendly and relateable. It's really a beautiful book to have in your collection. However, there are a some things glaringly missing, while other are provided in a surprising excess.The book has no recipes that include rutabaga, turnips, parsnips, radishes, eggplant, cabbage, beets appear once, and much to my surprise, it's extremely thin on greens (Paleo is supposed to be big on green leaves). Sure, there are a few recipes with spinach, salad greens and bok choy, but these are few and in between. Where is kale, collards, beet/turnip/radish, mustard and so many other greens? In other words, this book seems to be utilizing a few, rather \"common\" ingredients. Sure, you can't include every ingredient possible on a single book, but some of these veggies are important and nutritious-enough (e.g. kale) that should have been allowed a recipe page. Most of these ingredients mentioned are legal under the SCD, and are definitely all legal under Paleo.The book is rather thin on fish and shellfish recipes too, only including 8. While some faction of Paleo swears on grass-fed beef, there's a newer faction that gives equal importance to wild seafood (and sea vegetables, which are completely missing from the book btw). On top of that, almost everyone knows how to fry a tilapia or sear a salmon, these were unnecessary recipes. But very few know how to do a fish pie (with rutabaga, turnip or parsnip mash for a change, instead of the usual yams/cauliflower/celeriac), or lemon-garlic oysters in butter/ghee. Such recipes would have added more value to the book. Besides, the world is made with more than chicken (which is over-represented), beef, and pork. There's rabbit and game, sheep and goat meat, bird giblets -- all mysteriously missing. As for the biggest Paleo offence: not including a single offal recipe!Instead, we're fed pages over pages of not-so-healthy baking goods. I don't mind to have some recipes about cookies, a cake, some bread or crackers. We're just humans, so sometimes we want to indulge, or we have a birthday coming up. But when these types of recipes take ~1/3 of the book's pages, I think there's a fundamental problem right there. Especially since the author has her own health problems (like most of us who adopted Paleo/SCD because of health problems rather than just because of targeting weight loss), it becomes all the more important to include more wholesome food made with as much variety as possible, rather than having about 60 variations of almond/coconut flour and honey in various sweets. Instead of using so many pages on sugary recipes, I would have liked more actual food recipes with some of the missing ingredients mentioned above. Hopefully this will be corrected in the Second Edition.In conclusion: a great looking book, easy recipes to follow for newbies, but the book could have had more variety that would promote to its readers an even better health. Should you buy it? Yes. Should you use it exclusively? No, it's too myopic for the full range that is Paleo. There's a lot more ingredients to explore on a farmer's market and elsewhere.UPDATE: To make my point clear, there are TWO types of Paleo dieters: those who do it casually, for weight loss, for a small amount of time. This is the majority of people. And then, there are these who do it for health reasons, for a LIFETIME. The second type, is supposed to eat offal, game, fermented foods, wilds, and very few of these baked goods. The book fails on the second type of dieters, which is the one advocated by those who wrote the Paleo diet books. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Overall: 4 stars for amazing Thai food, friendly faces, bustling hot atmosphere. I've come back mainly because I was so impressed with the food. It's pricier and portions aren't huge, but this is balanced by high quality food and taste. Food:Not sure what more my review might add to what's already been said, but the food here is among the best Thai I've had in Toronto.I started off with the chicken skewers (Gai satay) and they were amazing. The skewers were very tender, juicy and flavourful.I tried their Pad Gra Prow in both pork and crispy pork. Personally I really preferred the crispy pork. It was crunchy, juicy and tender. The egg came put perfectly and the rice was delicious. I tried both the Goeng Klaw Wan (curry in a coconut and the Goeng Masaman (red curry). What stood out most to me was how rich each curry was. It was full bodied and creamy. I found myself tremendously impressed with the food. Medium spicy was fine by the way. Service:This is a bit of a difficult topic. They are very busy and popular. They try their best to accommodate but because of the traffic, I found that while the faces were friendly, it was hard to find my server. Getting drinks or refills was difficult because it's very noisy, and the waiters/waitresses are constantly on the go. Ambience:I love the decor. It's very spacious inside. There is loud upbeat music playing. This is not the kind of restaurant you want to go to for a quiet conversation. You will find yourself using your outdoor voice to communicate. The patio might be a better option for conversation. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What happens to the husband in the story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: 'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.  Linda Hanson (the fabulously talented Sandra Bullock) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck) have a happy life.  Nice home, two beautiful daughters, and a loving marriage.  Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.  But Linda remembers everything from the day before.  The film leaves you wondering which side of Linda's life is the real side, the one where she wakes up and Jim is alive, or the one where she wakes up and he's dead.  Small occurrences happen that tie the two realities together, such as a prescription from a psychiatrist and an accident with her oldest daughter.The suspense of the movie never reaches a gut wrenching level, and the soundtrack became annoying at times with its consistent \"doom-and-gloom\" sounds.  It seems as if there's a message hidden that some things are in our control, and some things are not.  The ending was a little too clich&eacute;d for my tastes.Overall, the movie just didn't quite live up to its promises, but the performances by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon are exceptional, carrying the weaker direction of the film.  It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Boy we are very critical of this film aren't we?Since when has Hollywood ever followed the plot in a book?  I know of only one film where they even remotely followed the book's plot so the fact that the Queen of the Dammed didn't even begin to follow the storyline of Anne's Rice's book should not surprise anyone in the whole wide world!Okay, with that cleared up I have to say I liked the film!  I liked all the actors; they were a credit to the roles they played with Stuart Townsend coming across very well as the tormented yet truculent vampire Lestat and David Talbot played by Paul McGann was really good as the man uneasy in the presence of vampires but drawn to them all the same.The Queen of the Damned is play by the late singer Aaliyah and I was surprised at how good she was, I wasn't expecting much but she did the role credit despite what other critics have said and I liked the idea of a Vampire becoming a rock superstar whose links to the Queen of the Damned are through his music and his drinking of her blood, a novel idea in my opinion.Akasha the Queen of the Damned is the mother of all Vampires, she knows no restraint, she will drink the world dry of mortal and immortal blood, she is sensual, she is a demon, she is blood lust all rolled into one violent and burning package and Lestat has awakened her and she wants to turn the world into her own little feast fest but she wants a King at her side and Lestat is going to be that King.Bring into the world of the Vampire and mortals Jesse played by the able actress Marguerite Moreau whose ties to the Vampire world is through an ancestor who before being made had born a child, and had watched over that child's descendents through the ages, add to that other Vampires, cruel, sensual, wicked, avaricious but occasionally compassionate and you have a heady tale of love, lust, desire, music and lashings of blood and pain.Good special effects, and a great sound track, all in all a great little horror flick that works well on the small screen!I quite liked the scene in the film when Jesse offers David immortality, she is now a Vampire herself and Lestat's consort but David hurriedly refuses, he likes his mortal ties.  However the Vampire Marius who made Lestat, played wonderfully by the delicious Vincent Perez has other ideas, Lestat is now with Jesse and Marius has his eye on David.  The film ends with Marius going into the library where David is alone and we know he is going to force David to become a Vampire!  A wonderfully ironic ending if there ever was one.My only regret is I didn't see this film on the big screen but it transfer to DVD quite well and it is a very enjoyable watch for those who love Vampire stories with more throat than gore.

      "Corresponding question: How is the show?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Firefly has the same problem that all of Whedon's shows have. It is unfocused and meanders for far too long. You can throw away about eight episodes a season because he does not know where he wants to go with them. He spends too much time fumbling around in the dark looking for a purpose or a plotline to follow and that is what happened with Firefly. The only difference is that he spends more time world building in this one instead of creating a purpose for the season.After seeing all of the episodes, well it does not live up to the hype. The characters are generic Whedon archetypes. It spends too much time with its being cutesy poo dialog, which is not witty or clever. It spends way too much time explaining insignificant details of the universe that will never pay off. I would probably have enjoyed the show, but the diehard Firefly fans ruined any enjoyment I might get out of it. They built this show up to be one of the greatest shows ever made, proclaimed every episode is golden and chided a network for acting like a business.And nd no, I'm not some lone warrior looking to start a fight. I'm just speaking to the truth that a lot of you are in denial about. Firefly failed not because of some correct order nonsense. If the producer had an idea where he was going, the show would have lasted longer. The general science fiction fanbase saw a badly made show that was confusing to follow. They saw a show whose producer did not have the decency to give them a reason to tune in the following week.Before you spout your correct order nonsense, the science fiction audience had an opportunity to see it in the correct order when SciFi aired for the 13 weeks leading up to the Serenity movie premiere. They did not watch it then, nor did they watch when it was on 13 hour marathons. It was the lowest rated show on SciFi. Ridicule it all you want, but this was from back in the day when SciFi still showed quality science fiction, like Galactica and Farscape. If it did poorly back then, what should that tell you about the show.I am sorry if you Whedonites do not like hearing this, but that is reality. If the show was good, then it did not matter the order it was aired. If the show was good, it would be in its 8th or 9th season. If the show was good, it would not need your wishful thinking and vitriolic responses to keep it alive. If the show was good, it would have expanded beyond the Whedonite audience. Sorry, but the show was not good and you are doing a disservice by hyping the hell out of it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The best art has a backstory of sacrifice and hardship and Mel Gibson's work of art, The Passion of the Christ has such a backstory.  In 2003, Passion producer Mel Gibson, was accused of every sort of malice from the Hollywood elite that is hostile to this movie, Christianity, and Western Civilization in general.The movie is the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and it is filmed in a color tone that reminds the viewer of a Renaissance painting of the same subject.  It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.  Greek is left out although it was the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire.The movie make a point to emphasize the various smaller Saints that were part of the story.  For example, Pontius Pilatus' wife, an Orthodox Saint, is favorably featured.  An Ethiopian servant is also shown as receptive to the message of Christ.The movie is graphic, torture and blood is featured, however the affair is artfully done.  Violence, after all is a major part of art.Most movies pushed from Hollywood is nothing more than \"dreck,\" but this work is high art melding the classic works of da Vinci, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo with the modern medium of cinema.  This movie should be shown on Network TV every Good Friday. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I give this two stars instead of one because it does have a valid point about adapting to the dizzying change going on around us and finding how to best contribute in this new world.However, the undeniable fact is that there is a lot less cheese than there used to be. The corporate CEOs, the crooked bankers, the defense contractors, the Walton family, and others have grabbed trillions of dollars worth of cheese from the rest of us. So, when we go in search of cheese, most people will find only inferior cheese--and much less of it.The moral of the story is that if we are suffering due to lack of cheese, it is our fault. It's the mean-spirited, idiotic ideology preached by Herman Cain, who told America, \"Don't blame Wall Street. Don't blame the big banks. If you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.\"  Yeah, right.BTW, if you're wondering where the cheese was moved, it's in the Caymen Islands and other offshore tax shelters.  According to Forbes Magazine, the super rich have stashed $21 Trillion in \"cheese.\" Maybe one day the people in our government will get some balls and make them bring it back.[...] ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: When Anchor Bay announced they were comming out with a Dawn of the Dead \"ultimate Edition\" they really meant it. You can see really see the blood sweat and tears that went through this dvd by looking at the cover. This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief. The packaging is amazing as well, you get an actual Dawn of the dead Comic book along with a good solid insert on all 4 discs. Overall one of the best movies and dvd packages of all time from Anchor Bay. A must buy! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am a Kindle Fire HD fan. (so some of you should stop reading now) The new Nexus 7 really gives the Kindle Fire a run for its money as an entertainment device. I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD. Since many, if not most of my books are Amazon, that is a bummer - I like text to speech for when I am driving and listening at bedtime. Audible's audiobooks works fine on both.Web Browsing. Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about. But there are a half dozen I would like that aren't on Amazon's store.- Kindle Fire's built-in ebook reader will display both Amazon and non-Amazon books and will do text to speech on them all.I own both, but if I had pick just one today, I'd pick the Nexus 7. BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, \"normal\" socket. And the Nexus buttons are tiny and I find myself fumbling to find them.If you have an older model and are thinking of upgrading, perhaps waiting to see what Amazon responds to the Nexus 2013 with would be good. To be totally honest, I am now a fan of both tablets. And married to an iPod Touch fangirl who demands a unit she can slip into her pocket. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I might just be the last person on the planet to read The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins' 2008 post-apocalyptic YA dystopian science fiction novel. After my wife raving about it, and with the movie coming up next month, I finally got to it, and I loved it. So if I was not, in fact, the last person to start this series and you haven't checked it out yet, read on to find out why you ought to read it as well.Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl in District 12, a coal-mining town in the country of Panem. She supports her family after her father died in mining accident several years before the events of the novel by illegally hunting in the nearby forests. Each year, as punishment for an uprising long ago, the Capitol randomly selects a one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 from each of the twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games, an arena death match where only one contestant can survive. When her 12 year old sister Prim is selected, Katniss volunteers to take her place.Collins artfully crafts an exciting story that fires on all cylinders. Action? I mentioned \"post-apocalyptic arena death match,\" right? Romance? More than covered. Compelling protagonist? Katniss is fantastic. She's strong, tough, determined, loyal, but she still has many of the normal concerns of a teenager, and flaws that make her believable. Interesting setting? Very much so. I devoured every bit about the world and wondered about what it implied for the larger setting, eager to find out more about what this unfortunate world is like and how it came to be.I've read several other dystopian novels - 1984, Brave New World, Cloud Atlas - and The Hunger Games fits right there alongside them, despite it's YA target audience and teen protagonist. I was amazed at how grim Collins could get and still manage to keep things YA. It actually reminded me some of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson such as Treasure Island, which can be challenging and have complex characters and violence, but still be appropriate for the younger reader. We seem to be living in a golden age of YA fiction that adults can enjoy, with Collins, J.K. Rowling, Scott Westerfeld and others crossing over to adult audiences with their excellent YA novels.I listened to the audio version, read by Carolyn McCormick. McCormick does an excellent job narrating the novel. She manages to convey the tension well, and her different accents and male voices are strong.As I said, I'm probably the last person to read The Hunger Games. But if not, if someone out there reads this review and hasn't read The Hunger Games yet, do so now. It's a great book, and I can't wait to keep reading and find out what happens in the rest of the trilogy. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

My wife and I traveled with our 2 year old toddler and we felt very comfortable in the room. Room size was small for a four star hotel and also the bathroom. But everything was clean and housekeeping is very courteous and helpful. Ipod dock in room was a nice touch as I left my charger back home. Don't expect too much from the room. It has a king size bed, comfortable sheets and comforter. The table in the room is a little small, television seems like it was bought from a surplus shop back in the early 90s but DVD player was appreciated. (movie rentals are available for about 12 bucks a night it would make more sense to buy a DVD disc at Borders or Virgin which are both a few blocks away.) There was also a serious lack of storage space in the room.Bathroom was tight. I mean real tight.Noise from the street is real bad. Once of the drawbacks of being in the city, I guess.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Clift and would stay there again if given a competitive rate.

      "Corresponding review: I want to poke. This is a complete OUTRAGE!! The authors of it, the editors of the book, and people giving 5 stars, are utterly mad and needs to go to either to a neurologist or jail! I don't want my children to grow up in a world like this! Your religion is an embarrassment for the whole universe: wars, inquisition, assassinations in name of God, fanatics all over, homosexual persecution, women discrimination, hunger, lies, manipulation, sexual abuse, Galileo torture, burning of books about knowledge ... what a world we live in! This is very sad. What did you learn at school people? In my country children learn evolutionism, reason, science and ethics. We learn how to be good, love everyone, accept different cultures, never be racist, accept homosexuality, go against wars, against hunger... I can't believe that in USA and other countries people still learn religion and old myths as if they were all facts. Religions are an insult to the \"Mother Nature\", to Life and to God itself.We share most of the genome with the chimps, sharing a common ancestor. We are ANIMALS! And we should be very proud of it! We should be proud to be alive and part of this fantastic nature. Animals have brains, consciousness, dreams, language (dolphins), feelings, fear, they feel sorrow for their death... all like us! The unique difference is that we are more intelligent and we have abstract thinking due to our brain evolution. Some animals are more intelligent than others, this is nature. Also, we have imagination that allow us to believe in invented religions! The universe is sooo big, soooooo dark, and sooo unknown, that by simply statistics we are not alone, 99.999% for sure. Aliens exist all over! They may be aware of us, or not. They probably have their own religions, or none at all! They probably think they are alone in the universe. The conditions for life to arise that took place on Earth happened all over the Universe. There are billions of other suns, planets and galaxies. Conclusion? We are not the chosen species, but we are the most selfish species in the whole universe! The universe is 13.700.000.000 years old. Huminids occupy only a tiny part of it. We're not safe from extinction. If humans get excincted, the universe will continue its course billions of years more... and some other species will arise, probably different than what we know.The Bible is a text written 2000-3000 years ago by primitive, ignorant and perverse people. Trying to make interpretations of the Bible is simply an excuse to keep believing in our religions. To be ancient doesn't mean that it is real, just the opposite. The Bible was written only 2000 years ago; the homo sapiens and other species of huminids (nearthendals, homo erectus, etc) have been in Earth thousands of years. Before us, dinosaurs and other extincted species inhabited our little planet. Why do you think God would decide to express itself only at this short period of the Earth timeline? The reality is that, people that wrote the Bible found an ingenous way to control masses and keep society quiet. They discovered that using a mystery like the dead, nobody would ever 100% prove the existence of an invented heaven or hell. Religions are tales to explain the unknown. But nowadays science has evolved so much that we no longer need religion to explain most things. Humanity have been always cruel. Romans practised slavery, sent people to the lions, etc. people like those are who wrote the Bible.If you read the Bible you will discover it's perverse. If an all-knowing entity like God would have written it, the Bible would contain awesome knowledge. Instead, it contains:* Creationism: the world, oceans, stars, plants, etc. were created in seven days, without any scientific explanation of it. Ridiculous. Read about Big Bang.* Intelligent design: read about evolution.* No place for dinosaurs.* The age of Earth is ridiculous.* Geocentrism: Earth is neither flat nor the center of the universe. We are the most selfish.* The divinity of rainbow: it's just a natural effect of light scattering. In fact, I can see a rainbow every time I wash my hands in my office bathroom.* Noe's boat: how do you put 1.7 million of species in a boat? Animals like crocodiles or sharks have been around in Earth millions of years.* Slavery, discrimination of women, children aasassination: I want to throw up.* Miraculous healings: learn about placebo and the power of faith.* Angels with wings, spirits...: all fantasy* Heaven, Hell, plagues: thanks to fear, it's a way to compensate those who obey, and punish those who doesn't* The last paragraphs of the Bible states that any who adds or takes out something in the Bible will suffer from eternal punishment. It is clear a way for people who wrote it to cause doubt and fear to thouse who will not obey.* God created us in his resemblance. If a single intelligent being exists outside our planet, this falls apart completely.* Does God speak English, French, German, Spanish...?Do you think an all-knowing, all-loving entity, would write such a thing?There are 99.999% of possibilities that after death there's nothing! This is life, and we MUST accept it as it is. Birth means nothing without dead. Everything has a beginning and an ending. Where is the problem of it? Our memories, consciousness, thoughts, feelings... mysterious and intangible things: that neuroscience can explain them! Mind comes with the brain. Check diseases like Alzheimer or Schizophrenia, alcohol, drugs... and see how  chemistry or brain damage affect our vision of reality. Spirits, NDE, OBE,... all depends on culture and have scientific proof: our complex brain that tricks us. All those testimonies, those stories about life after death, are simply tricks of the brain. Memory is proven to reside in our neurons. Brain damage can erase it completely. How would you explain that someone who leaves its body returns remembering those experience? The reason is simple: they never left the body or the brain behind. They had hallucinations, dreams, whatever. Their experiences always match their religions and culture. This is how our subconsciousness work!Have you ever lost consciousness? Your ego and existence comes to absolutely nothing! Where's the eternal part of it during it? It dies with the brain cells, returning to nature what we borrowed from it. Before our birth we were absolutely nothing, we were not eternal, and won't be; death works the same way. And I accept life as it is: a complex and beautiful experience.Life is very hard, please, don't make it even more difficult than it already is.Science has found things so hidden and complex such as Higgs' Bosson, electromagnetism, quantic physics, medicine... but never paranormal things!Fanatics, are you asking indigenous people, children with cancer, people with brain diseases, other cultures, other religions, tribes in the remote Amazon jungle, to believe in your myth?I can believe in some form of God, because nature is amazing and very complex. However, who created God? Therefore, I can also believe that there is no God at all. Reality is that nobody knows. But science has proved that something can arise from nothing.What is true is that I'll never believe in your ideas! Religion causes irreversible psychological damage, it has brought crimes and hell in Earth. And you still worship God as someone loveable and fair. How can you love someone who sends poor children, good and honest people to hell? If God exists, he gave us brains to think critically, and to have free. If your God existed, I prefered to go to hell along with my family, friends, wife, children, and other brilliant people in human history, rather than going to heaven to worship a cruel and unfair God while seeing how loveable people is tortured FOREVER. Fanatics, do you understand what eternity means? It means that for simply not believing what several ancient people wrote in a perverse book you will be tortured billions of billions of years, and afterwards, you will be tortured billions of billions of years more, and so on. Only for some free thinking you had during your brief life span. It does not matter at all how much you loved, how many people you helped, nothing matter. It only matters to have blind faith in a book that loves slavery, assassinations and women discrimination. Am I going to hell simply by loving and accepting life as it is?Most people say: what if you are wrong and hell is real? If you believe and you are wrong you do not lose nothing. Instead, if you do not believe and you are wrong, you get punished. This is called Pascal's wanger, and thanks to this the Church still exists, earning money, sexualy abusing from children, and giving delusion to people's lives. Let's try an experiment! Imagine I now publish a book explaining I have had a Near-Death Experience. In this NDE I have met God. God have told me that Earth is a mess, that life in other planets is great. That religions are only human inventions to relief their fear to death. God also tells me that the unique religion is the religion of love. And finally God tells me that those who believe and teach religions like Christianty will go to hell for lying and causing phsycological damage to innocent people. Do you have any evidence that I am lying? I have exactly the same evidence that those who claim the Bible was written by God.Can't you see people that using the word \"faith\" everyone can make you believe ANYTHING he wants? No matter how inverosimile it seams! Faith is so powerful, and the brain so complex, that people actually end up seeing God, Jesus or whatever they were told to exist.Another point. Isn't your God so infinitely fair? I can ensure he is not fair at all:* People before Jesus did not believe in him. But they are saved automatically.* People at the time of Jesus believed in him because they saw him during their lives.* People nowadays are obviously losing faith, because time changes and society evolves.* Some people claim that have met Jesus or God in person. That is, they will go to heaven by evidence, while others have to go to heaven by simple faith. How fair, isn't it? They are simply liars, dreamers or manipulators.* People in 2000 years will no longer believe in him because science will have evolved and we will have probably created artificial consciousness and demonstrated that soul is a myth.* People who live in other parts of the world, in the jungle, in India, etc. will never believe in him.Aren't you aware this is completely unfair? This the most archaic plan for an entity so powerful that has created our complex universe.Fanatics, you are the most despicable people in the universe for assuring that people who don't feel what you believe, will go to eternal punishment. If some form of God is real, he will punish you for bringing Hell in Earth.You know what? Hell is real. It's in the Earth every day. It's in our heads. Please, live your life at most. And let live. Love. Help. Have children. Live is wonderful, is amazing, and mysterious. Find your light yourself, don't believe what ancient people wrote for their interest.If you want more information go to webpages like whywontgodhealamputees, godisimaginary, richard dawkings foundation, Victor Stenger, etc. Learn more about the chemical of consciousness. And finally, learn the Bible and see the nonsense of it and the intentions behind the people who wrote. It was written in an age where slavery, woman discrimination, miracles, exorcism to epileptic people, ignorance, etc. where completely normal. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Human answer: This war movie is absolutely fantastic and well\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: It's hard to believe that the company that made this incredible film; Constantin Film; also made the excellent Resident Evil films and the not-so-great Fantastic Four movies (bleh). This war movie is absolutely fantastic and well-deserving of the many awards and critical acclaim it received.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1945, and the Russians are closing in on Germany and the Third Reich. So the main leaders of the Third Reich; Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbel along with his wife and children, and various employees and military leaders hide in a bunker to avoid capture from the Russians. The story is basically told from the point of view from Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, who was in the bunker during the last days of the war and a witness to the downfall of the Third Reich and escaping from the Russians.MUSIC: There's not much unfortunately, that's what makes this movie flawed.STORYLINE: This story is well told about these historical events and is beautifully and masterfully carried out.ENTERTAINMENT: This film is brilliant, and near-perfection. This is one of those movies you have to have real taste for, otherwise you might get bored. It definitely isn't for kids. What makes this film all the more authentic is that the film is in German giving the already amazing feel another injection of compelling drama. This is one of the best war dramas (and dramas in general) ever made, it's compelling, the acting is great, it feels very real, and it is a masterpiece.OVERALL: You're not going to find a whole lot of foreign films this great, or for that matter, great films in particular (Hollywood really sucks these days; there is virtually nothing good to speak of). Watch this movie, you owe it to your movie-loving self to watch one of the best dramas, best war movies, best foreign movies, and one of the best movies to come out in years. This is not my favorite movie, but this is one of the more better quality films I've watched in a while amid the many stinkers I've watched.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, feels authentic, it's brilliant, and it's just a flatout masterpiece.THE BAD: Very little music.

      "Human answer: the the coffee itself really matters to me\n",
      "Corresponding question: Is the flavor tasty?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Since I drink my coffee black without any creamer or sweeteners, the taste of the coffee itself really matters to me.  This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

As Stanely Kubrick's last movie it shows what the director was capable of but is rather lacking at  the same time.Despite what many have said about the film, it isn't a  porno movie. Sorry.  It is a series of adventures into a intresting dream  world.  Every scene is very well shot and unique.  In fact it's fair to say  that the whole isn't the sum of it's parts.  While all the different  encounters Tom Cruis's character has are well-done and intresting, they  don't fell connected and the story falls apart quickly.  Also, the audience  never really gets a sense of Cruis's or Kidman's character.The film  also feels rather incomplete.  Many times it apears the story is heading  toward an interesting confrontation only to have the plot abandon the  situation and head in a completely different direction.  I still recommend  seeing Eyes Wide Shut but the film could have been so much more. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Starting with the most important factor in reviewing a tea ... taste ... it is pleasant. I have a difficult time putting much credibility into a review for a food/beverage product which claims the product \"tastes great\" or \"tastes awful\" since taste is 100% personal and subjective. I also won't pick apart how authentic the flavors are, because again, personally I think the taste is pleasant and I would make it a point to purchase this flavor in the future.Possibly because of the tea bag material, or maybe because of the chunkiness of the tea, it brews fast, making a drinkable cup of tea in just over a minute. On the plus side, if I leave the teabag in until I finish the entire cup it still does not become bitter. My personal choice is about 3 - 4 minutes.Speaking of the teabag, there are some interesting opinions about it. Frankly it doesn't mean a lot to me. On the positive side it has an attractive look to it which helps dress up serving tea at an informal dinner party. On the more negative side I have to wonder about any \"plastic\" product that may leech into my beverage. Each time I have to peel the string off the side of the teabag I wonder what's in the glue that holds it there.Lipton is very respected in our household so the bottom line is I'm not so concerned about the material that's used to make the teabag to not buy it, and overall this is clearly a bit more of a premium tea than average. I believe it is getting rated fairly at 4-stars for \"I like it\". ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: From the moment I saw the first trailer, I wanted to see this movie.  I finally got a chance to see it last month and I was not disappointed.  This is easily of of the best films of the year with probably the best cast of the year.  This film is based of the best selling book of the same name and David O' Russell captured it perfectly.  The film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano.  His mom has just picked him up from a mental institution in which he has spent the last eight months for assaulting his wife's lover.  Even though the doctors feel as though he needs more time there, Pat leaves and head home...well at least his parent's home.  Pat wants to get his life back on track and his wife back by working out, reading his wife's summer reading list for her class and work on his \"issues\" even though he believes he does not need his medication in order to do it.  This is going to be easier said then done because right after his fight with his wife's lover, she put a restraining order on him, she moved away and he lost his teaching job.  After being invited to dinner by his friend, Ronnie, he meets Tiffany.  A woman who has just lost her policeman husband and has issues of their own.  Even though things are rocky between to two of them at first, they eventually form an odd friendship.  When Pat learns that Tiffany has a personal connection to his wife, Nikki, the two of them strike up a deal.  If he agrees to be her partner at an upcoming dance competition, she'll agree to supply his wife a letter from him.  At first glance, this might seem like a crazy idea for a romantic comedy drama and that there is no way in hell that this could work.  Having said that, this film amazingly works.  Its funny, heartfelt, insightful and inspiring.  What makes it so good is that all of these people are not caricatures of people.  They are real people with real hopes, dreams and issues.  To me, the best characters are the ones we can identify with and you can do that to a certain extent with each of these characters.  David O' Russell directed and wrote this film.  I give him credit for being able to make a great film that included mental illness, the Philadelphia Eagles, comedy and drama all in the same film.  He got nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The Fighter (another amazing film) and should receive writing and directing nominations at the next Oscars.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly one of the best and brightest stars today.  Even though her character is suppose to be older and she was only 21 at the time of filming, she is completely believable as a damage woman looking for a silver lining in her life.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for Winter's Bone, gave another acclaimed performance in the huge blockbuster The Hunger Games and I see another Oscar nomination for this film.  She deserved the first one and she really deserves another one.  Robert De Niro is back ladies and gentleman.  After a few years of films and performances that were not that well received, he comes back with a vengeance in this film as Pat's OCD father.  Add to his list another Oscar nomination for this performance.  He walks the line of concerned father and superstitious Eagles fan beautifully.  Jacki Weaver was great as his concerned mom.  She earned a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for Animal Kingdom as the mom from hell and she does a complete 180 as as woman that wants to see her son get back on her feet.  I think she should get another one for this film.  Chris Tucker was in the film as Pat's friend from the mental institution and all I have to say is welcome back Chris.  We know him mostly as loud mouth characters from Money Talks, Friday and the hugely successful Rush Hour franchise.  He really tones it down to be a more realistic character and he is still funny as hell.  I don't know it it will happen but he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination because he was truly memorable in this film.  The rest of the supporting cast is great as well in their roles.  I reserve the highest acclaim for Bradley Cooper.  We mostly know him from comedies like Wedding Crashers, Hit and Run, and the highly acclaimed (and funny as hell) The Hangover.  Last year, he made a film called Limitless that showed that he does have some range.  His performance from Silver Linings Playbook takes that to another level.  This is not only his best performance to date but this is also one of the best performances of the year.  He was extremely believable as Pat.  Even though his character was highly troubled, we saw a guy that was really trying to get his act together.  You see Pat at his best and you see him at his worst.  You feel for him from the moment he leaves the mental hospital to the moment the film ends.  You really want him to get his silver lining.  If he is not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, it will be a travesty.  This is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best films ever made. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I literally bought this book a little over 24 hours ago and what can I say, it really keeps your attention. If you are like me and love a good romance novel then stop reading reviews and just buy it right now because you won't be disappointed.PROS- Great character development. I could mentally imagine every single character and fell in love with some of them, could relate to some of their problems and literally cried when they cried at times.- Good story line. There was drama when there needed to be. There were comical moments, many sad moments and some very happy times as well. The story developed into something that really touched my heart. Dealing with death is not something to easily write about, however, Young elaborates on it beautifully and shows how to deal with and get over the loss of a loved one.- Heated romance. Need I say more?CONS- The only two bad things that I can really say about the book is that first of all, it was somewhat predictable. The hinted foreshadowing is far from subtle. Although there were a few moments in the book that I was actually caught by surprise and wasn't expecting it to happen.- Secondly, there were a lot of similarities between this book and the Fifty Shades series. Both had characters that were really mentally messed up. Both have the main male character being drop dead sexy, rich businessmen that are very protective over the women they love, and have also been through terrible tragedy. Both main male characters also get into bar fights. However, as I got deeper and deeper into the book, I was finding more and more differences between them where I was able to mentally separate them, but in a good way. Now that I have read the entire book, I can say that although it does share some characteristics with Fifty Shades of Grey, On Dublin Street differentiates enough from it to make it unique and a very very good read.In my opinion, it would make an excellent movie that would really teach an important life lesson.

      "Corresponding review: Just stayed at this hotel recently. I have lived in SF for years and wanted to stay but since I moved away I was able to. This hotel is very funky and fun. The staff are very cool, nice and knowledgeable. The price is about average for SF and the renovated rooms are very comfortable. This is especially a good place for people into live music (many bands stay here) and want a true San Francisco experience. It's close to all the things most people want and even have a map to the best live music venues. Just ask the staff for any help and they will oblige. If you are looking for a fancy, overpriced hotel, this is not the place for you. It is very comfortable, the continental breakfast is good, people seemed to be enjoying the heated pool...it was 48 degrees outside so we passed on that but there were people still partaking. I've heard that the restaurant and nightclub is very good altho we had just danced our &quot;*&amp;^es&quot; off at the Warfield so we were quite beat. All I can say if you want a fun experience, give the Phoenix Hotel a try...it is a better choice for those young or young at heart! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I definitely recommend going with a large crowd as the dishes are meant to be shared, something that I did not know when I made a reservation. For the starters we had the Duck Kibbeh, Shakshouka, and the Organic House Labneh. The kibbeh's were out of this world savoury! As a main we had Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, Yogurt Baked Fluke, Lamb Rack, and the Sweet Jeweled Rice. To finish off the meal we had Pavlova and the Loukoumades. I also ordered the The Rose Gulab cocktail; it was one of the best cocktails I have ever had! The Shakshouka is also one of the best dishes I have ever eaten at a restaurant ever; it was absolutely mind-blowing. The staff were extremely friendly and the atmosphere was wonderful.

      "Corresponding review: *reviewed my MM's (Katie) -Warning: while reading this book you may experience severe reactions to amor deliria nervosa, also known as falling in love, something that's \"cured\" aka banned in Delirium's society. Side effects may include sleepless nights while reading Delirium, the inability to concentrate on anything else but reading this book, nervousness over what's going to happen to Lena & Alex, having your heart ripped out, sighing, finding yourself sitting on the edge of your seat, kissing your book, running out to pre-order PANDEMONIUM, petting the new beautiful cover, telling all your friends to go pick up this book, and of course falling helplessly in love with the brilliant, and breathtakingly beautiful writing of Lauren Oliver.Can you imagine living in a society where LOVE is a disease?! I seriously loved the way Lauren created a fascinating society that \"cures\" love. Yes it may seem hilarious, but when you read DELIRIUM it totally makes sense. Lauren's writing is just awesome! It's richly detailed, it's poetic, captivating and I love that she really makes me think. Lauren is truly a gifted writer and I swear she could write a story about the most outlandish thing and make it credible. Here's a taste of Lauren's beautiful prose, which is also one of my favorite quotes from DELIRIUM:Sometimes I feel like if you just watch things, just sit still and let the world exist in front of you- sometimes I swear that just for a second time freezes and the world pauses in it's tilt. Just for a second. And if you somehow found a way to live in that second, then you would live forever. - pg 153This is one of the many reasons why I adored Lena, the story's main protagonist. She's insightful and I admired the way she fights to believe in something she's grown up being taught vs something that's right in front of her face telling her otherwise. I love a character who has a quest for finding the truth, no matter how heartbreaking that truth can be and how much they'll have to sacrifice in order to get it. Alex is a character I immediately loved. He challenges everything that Lena has been taught. I love the way in which he makes her think and helps her open her eyes to the truth around her. I of course loved the way their relationship developed over the course of the book.I'm surprised at how much I loved this book considering there isn't a lot of action, there's no paranormal characters and the characters aren't as in-depth as I usually like them. What a beautiful change of pace this book is for me! This is a book that completely snuck up on me and swept me off my feet with it's beautiful writing style, romantic story line, and it's well developed characters. Oh Lauren Oliver the things you did to my heart in this book..... Luckily my heart won't be ripped out for long as I'm off to drown my broken heart in PANDEMONIUM. Seriously, if you haven't already go PICK UP DELIRIUM! You'll enjoy every moment experiencing the side effects of amor deliria nervosa while reading Lena's story. There is very mild language in this book.** Reviewed by Sophie for Mundie Moms-Love. Stories, poems, films, songs have been created in an attempt to explain the concept. But imagine growing up in the United States where love didn't exist. I saw you blink slowly as you read that last sentence. What if there was a cure for love? I know what you're thinking -- no thanks, I don't want it. But what if the government made you take it when you turned eighteen? There would be less divorce, less violence, less reliance upon pharmaceuticals, less addiction. You get the idea.Lauren creates such a world and introduces us to her protagonist, Lena, who is just a few months from taking the cure. In these last weeks, she thinks a lot about what life will be like for her after the cure. All around her, we see the effects of cured family members and friends. They're happy with their lives and go on with their daily activities with a predicatble rhythm. But is this what Lena wants? As Lena and her best friend, Hana, begin to question some of the government teachings and rules, the reader discovers how far the government has gone to eradicate the concept, feeling and existence of love.I have to admit to sitting back and admiring the absolute plausibility of such a concept. The excerpts of government approved literature at the start of each chapter set the tone for what Lena and Hana have learned all of their lives. As a reader, you can't help feeling sympathetic for them. This level of propoganda is all they know. It is their truth. And then the reality of the horror unfolds as you find out what happens to those who do fall in love and are caught.I'm a huge fan of well-written dystopian stories and Lauren has penned one that rings true and shakes our most sacred belief system. To top it off, her prose is so lyrical, at times, that yes, I paused to text KatieB and even call her to read a few sentences out loud. I am thrilled that this will be a trilogy and that the movie rights have been optioned.If you enjoy a love story where love is truly forbidden, pick up DELIRIUM on February 1st. You will realize that a unifying, maddening and unpredictable concept like love will remain even when threatened. It'll be that loose thread in a tightly woven fabric and the temptation to pull it will be overwhelming. So what would happen if you did fall in love in such a society? I know, I'm still thinking about it.A quick aside for those Mundie Moms who will ask me -- but is there romance? I will confess that there is a multiple-page Kissy Scene that I may have read more than once. And there is...Alex. Mundie Moms, trust me, you will want to meet him. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is the best Sci-Fi I've seen in decades. I don't often hand out praise. This movie was enjoyable to watch a dozen times when I received it and is highly recommended. An excellent cast although there was no chemistry with the actress who played Julia. Olga was not right for the part. She lacked the on screen presence and appeal and simply did not mesh with Cruise on screen. It wasn't any lack of acting. They simply lacked the chemistry needed for the role she played. They needed someone who stands out in a crowd and has sincerity in their eyes. I also think once the background story was known... it should have emphasized the fact that their marriage was kept secret from their crew and aerospace command center at the time which is why she wore the ring around her neck. It also should have included the fact that Vika had interests in him at the beginning and did not know about his marriage. Those two issues were not made clear.I was delighted that there was no blood and gore for a change other than a stain on a shirt. So thank you to the director, writer and producers for not subjecting the audience to violent gore.This was clearly the best set design I have ever seen when it came to the sky house. I found their front projection quite effective and visually stunning for both the audience and cast.The story had some wonderful new ideas... and it might have been nice to have seen some scenes of the thousands who came to attack 50 years earlier.This movie did have a unique story. A wonderful clean, futuristic design of architecture and high-tech devices. The intent to bring Sci-Fi back out into the sunlight is a concept I agree with. Over the years it had become dark and dirty and violent which is a turn off and most of us are sick and tired of those other grungy sci-fi's. While this did have some drone battle scenes (which were a bit long for my taste... but that's what fast forward is for) but some of the most important scenes were cut in favor of useless, prolonged drone battles inside a power plant and unnecessary CGI expense. Battle scenes are boring and monotonous & the audience is quite tired of them.Hasn't anyone noticed that the blockbuster hit movies all had good personal stories, limited battle scenes and no dark, dank or grungy... hit movies like Independence Day. This movie is also one of the best movies in recent years.In general it is the depth of the story, the characters & interaction, the cast and visual technologies which are important. Movies need the audience to invest their emotions. This movie aced the technology and clean futuristic architecture. The relationship with Vika was quite unique. She did a superb job of acting and nearly stole the entire film. The cast was excellent. The designs were beautiful as was the concept. I thought the writers approach to selling the story was a refreshing change from their usual antiquated script formats. I'm amazed it worked. I think more should have been done with Tet and we are more interested in seeing additional scenes of the condition of the cities and survivors survival attempts (like the grain crop concept in The Host) than barraging us with battles. This movie was very sparing about that so it was appreciated. Only 2 significant battle scenes which were fast forwarded through.The 3 most glaring errors were the deleting of the archives scene where Morgan showed him the book of his career. In fact, there should have been more scenes of the archives and more on what they had salvaged. The second was a simple blunder in the script dialogue. Vika told Sally that she needed a drone to scout grid 17 and Sally responds that she is sending a drone to grid 22. Clearly... Sally should have sent the drone to grid 17. Grid 22 wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Someone should have caught that either on editing or at least when prescreening the movie without talking through it... and someone might have heard the mistake. It was pretty glaring. And finally, to hear Morgan talking about waves and bedrock in Chicago was a bit ridiculous. While New York and San Francisco are on bedrock and next to an ocean for tidal waves... Chicago is not on bedrock as far as I know... I've drilled in all three areas... and certainly would not be subject to Tsunami's from the great lakes. Some wave action perhaps... but would not bury Chicago... so that was the third glaring error.It was also obvious that Sally wasn't quite right in the first few minutes with the constant asking about being an \"effective team\". Her Texas accent was also waaay overdone. Plus, I would have waited a few minutes and established the future before doing the dream sequence rather than opening the movie with it. There also should have been more lighting in the lower level workshop. Most workshops are brightly lit. His should have been no different in that respect. But the set for their house was fabulous. I'd like to see all Sci-Fi's use projection screens like that.Unlike some people who judge actors on their personal lives, those issues are of no interest and should not be an issue in regard to the success of a movie. I only care how they do on screen and I must say they were all terrific with the chemistry exception I noted.However... we could have done without the cigar and the goggles on Morgan Freeman. It was not only ridiculous that he would still have access to Cigars after 50 years considering the planet was a wasteland... but it is about time to stop pushing tobacco products on our films. It is a gross affront to the audience especially when it has been banned in practically every building in the country... so what makes these filmmakers think we want to see some nasty cigar... especially Sci-Fi fans who usually have backgrounds in science, technology or engineering. Most of us know better than to smoke and don't enjoy watching it either. Prometheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films. Microsoft or Sony or Toshiba, Apple or Verizon. Not tobacco companies. They should know that watching someone smoke only repulses people these days. It doesn't work like it did in the 40's. It does not make anyone want to smoke unless they are already addicted.We probably could have done without the scene of the 3 drones in that dark, dripping, dingy power plant. I hope the Director and producers realize you exposed your crew and cast to dangerous PCB's and lead and sulfuric acid left behind in that abandoned plant you chose to film in. It can't be cleaned from the concrete floors. It seeps into the concrete floors and then rained down all over the cast and crew during filming. That particular dark, grungy site  also contradicted your intention to bring Sci-Fi back in to the sunlight.I find it disturbing when the directors expose the cast and crew to hazardous and unpleasant conditions. What purpose did it serve to place that poor girl in a tank top in Iceland where she was freezing? It certainly didn't add to her appeal. And why would you allow your high dollar star to become injured? That knee or neck injury could affect him for the rest of his life. It was clear he was having great pain and difficulty walking on it during the library scene. The audience does  not require nor appreciate the actors being injured or subjected to miserable conditions. I think any directors who do this should be banned for life from working on any more films, regardless of how well the movie may have done. Injuring an actor is inexcusable and unnecessary. Their contracts should spell out that they are prohibited from engaging in precarious behavior which may result in injuries. In addition to the damage to the actor, it could bankrupt a studio and infuriate an audience over the gross inconsideration shown to the cast. NO movie is important enough to cause harm or discomfort to a cast... such as filming in 100 degree weather as Star Trek Generations did to 3 star actors who could have died from heat related heart attacks as did Clark Gable and John Candy under similar conditions... or like this movie... putting their actors on top of a mountain Cliff in Iceland. Cruise is over 51 and shouldn't be running up cliffs and high sand dunes if he doesn't want to end up like Ritter, Gable and Candy... despite how energetic he feels. Guys who go overboard to overdo everything to prove their youth are prime candidates for fatal heart attacks.If you want Iceland... then green-screen it. We won't know the difference. Many of us have a long memory about damage to actors and stunt crews... Harry Potter's stunt double who is paralyzed. Vic Morrow and 2 children dead from a helicopter crash on set. Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet age 12 caused a life long back injury. William Shatner with Tinnitus. Ida Lupino, Wayne and crew from cancers after filming in fallout Nevada. I didn't look up any of these incidents. We do remember these incidents and it definitely needs to stop.I'm willing to bet Cruise will require arthroscopic surgery on that knee in 5 years and will end up with stenosis from the neck hyperextension in less than 10 years just from that one library scene in this movie. Frankly, I don't think any movie is worth it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

I rotate my teas and last year when I did a special school tour under my entertainer incarnation I drive 49,000 miles, did 260 school shows -- and traveled with an electric kettle and about six kinds of teas. I have NEVER had Pu'erh tea before -- and it was not just a revelation due to its richness and rich flavor, but due to the wonderful aroma and the energy I  had after drinking it. I'm a huge cardamom fan so that made this tea a plus. Since I never had this before I tried adding my usual sugar -- and actually that was TOO MUCH. Due to the cardamom I found (for me) that the tea is excellent if I just add a small amount of sugar. This tea will be a regular now in my rotation but it may well be my regular morning tea, with others rotated in place sparingly. WONDERFUL! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Ohhhh yea. The meals I love the best are the one's that surprise me. After finding this place on Yelp, I ventured on over to see if I could walk in and grab a table. The place was jam packed and their was a decent wait, but luckily I was able to snag a seat the bar. The rest is history.With old school r&b playing in the background, I ordered some fried spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai. While I was waiting I chatted it up with a bartender who gave me the low down on the restaurant as well as the area and where to go. After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place. This place is great for group gatherings and overall just somewhere to go have a good time. Definitely will be back here at some point, and you should go check it out too! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I picked up this book simply because I was looking for something new to read on the same day I happened to hear it won the Pulitzer. I'm glad I did, however, because it was exactly what I was looking for. Engaging, well-paced (especially for its length), with interesting and (mostly) well-rounded characters. I took me a bit to get into it, but once I did I was hooked entirely--often reading it when I really should have been doing other things. Tartt excels as exhibiting Theo's journey so naturally and seemlessly, that every action he takes makes complete sense for his character. You completely understand why he gravitates to the people he does, why he needs to self-medicate the way he does, why he follows the path he follows. Many authors tend to shoehorn these details into their characters in order to further their plot, but with Theo, his causes and effects made perfect sense.My problems with the book, while I adored most of it (particularly Theo's youth), the last bit--the ending--felt off. There was a lot of exposition, which the reader needed for closure, but it came off as quite the \"info-dump\".  The last scene with Boris, followed immediately by the last scene with Hobie--it was very much one character telling us everything we needed to know, while Theo stood in for the reader asking the questions we had in a very \"so then what happened?\" manner. Yes, we got our answers, but given how great the book had been, I was just hoping for it to play out a bit differently.Also, there were time where the lengthy descriptions of unnecessary things (furniture, for example) got so detailed that it would take you out of the book; I'd find myself skipping paragraphs a time and losing nothing from the story. The book probably could have been 200 pages shorter if an editor had simply trimmed some of the superfluous descriptions down.Lastly, I didn't find any of the female characters to be as fully fleshed out as I had hoped. Each of the more prominent ones seemed to filling a very particular place hold in Theo's life, but I knew very little about any of them outside of that role. In turn, you look at characters like Boris and Hobie, who also hold specific roles in Theo's life, but yet their characters also stand on their own two feet outside of Theo. I would have loved that for more of the females.Enjoyed the book on the whole, however. Would recommend. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the relationship?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I didn't think it was possible, but Stephanie Perkins managed to make me love Lola and the Boy Next Door even more than Anna and the French Kiss. Another home run for the Queen of Contemporary Young Adult Romances.Lola was not your average girl. She saw every day as a chance to reinvent herself, with wigs and costumes; she marched to her own drummer and if you didn't like it, tough noogies. She lived with her too-good-to-be-true dads and dated an older \"bad boy.\" Everything was going pretty dandy for Lola until her old neighbors moved back into the house next door.I loved Lola's dads - they let her just be herself and were there when she needed them. They were kind (to each other and to her) and thoughtful and just quirky enough. Her boyfriend, Max, was a few years older, and this was mentioned several times, in an effort to make their relationship almost... naughty. I didn't think the age difference was that big a deal.The neighbors, the Bells, included twins Calliope and Cricket. Calliope was a talented figure skater whose family had moved back to town to advance her career. She was spoiled and selfish, and not a likable character at all. Cricket, well he's one of my favorite book boyfriends ever. He was sweet and nerdy and made of pure awesome.Most of the novel was spent building up the horrible thing that Cricket did to Lola before the Bells moved away, and once we found out what he did, it was a huge letdown. Honestly, it was no big deal at all, and I thought she overreacted quite a bit. The dialogue was fun and real; Lola really had a tendency to say what she was thinking, which led to some amusing situations.The setting of the novel was so well described, I felt like I was right there in San Francisco with the characters. Everything was so lush and descriptive, I loved it. For fans of Anna and the French Kiss, we are treated to a few scenes with Anna and Etienne in Lola. They are just as in love, and Anna provides a sounding board when Lola needs someone to talk out her issues.There were a few clich&eacute;s, and some predictable bits, but they were few and far between. The quirky and fun nature of the book more than made up for those few drawbacks. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The movie Chicago has it all. Music, Dancing, Sexiness and Style. I watched the movie in theatres hoping that it will exceed my expectations and it did...a lot. The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back. So check this movie out and you'll see what Chicago has up it's sleeve. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Hello, This is my first review for the Sony MDR-V6 with CCAW Voice Coil.SoundFirst I would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing. I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100.

      "Corresponding question: How is the parking rate?\n",
      "Corresponding review: We were with a group for a youth conference at AT&amp;T park, and our group leader booked the hotel directly. He tells me that there was some confusion on the part of the night staff when we arrived at about midnight--it took a very long time to check in. He also says the desk staff in the morning was the opposite--very sharp and helpful. People might think that $27 for parking is high, but it's very reasonable compared to the rest of the city. Location was very convenient for our purposes. Yes, there are homeless in the neighborhood, but none of them approached us, and we felt that our kids were quite safe, with proper precautions we would use in any city (daytime only, always with adult supervisors). Rooms were not fancy, but were very clean. Bedding was adequately comfortable, but not &quot;ahhhh.&quot; My bathroom had shower beginning to show signs of wear (cracking tiles), but tile and grout were perfectly clean. The 4th floor rooms open onto what I call a &quot;hanging courtyard&quot; running the length of the building, which is very nice for sitting with coffee in the morning. I was told that the upper floors (where others from our group stayed) had great views. The hotel is a good value for the price. There are several places to eat nearby on Market Street, including a &quot;mom and pop&quot; style diner, Burger King, and a coffee place. To sum up, if you want a good, functional, convenient hotel that's nicer than a motel, this is the place. If you want a nice, pampering experience, then you need to splurge somewhere else.

      "Corresponding review: I wrote off Guu Izakaya (Church St.) after three visits.  The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  2. The space is really impressively designed.  3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. While I hatehatehate ordering from a Deep Fried section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the Cold Dishes to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.  Guu enforces a 2-hour maximum mealtime, but we finished shy of an hour.  Our abundance of dishes could have been more thoughtfully paired, served, and spaced out.  It would have made a huge difference.If you're going to eat at Guu, go to SakaBar in the Annex.  It's also a more mature and diverse crowd, beyond herds of Ryerson students fighting each other with textbooks for octopus balls. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: bland pasta with \" meat \" sauce\n",
      "Corresponding question: How are pasta is firm?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This microwaveable package contains a single serving of rather bland pasta with \"meat\" sauce.  It is perfect for the busy person on the go who doesn't want to be too bothered with (and doesn't care much about) lunch.  The package is easily portable, does not require refrigeration and easily microwaves in a mere minute.  Simply pull back the cover to the marked line, microwave, then pour the sauce on the pasta.  Although the packaging indicates that the microwaved product will be hot, my finished product was just right - not scalding hot like most microwave meals tend to come out.  But then, I used an 800 watt microwave.But when all is said and done, the product is edible and not much more.  The \"meat\" sauce contains small traces of something that could be meat, but I'd need a microscope to be sure.  The sauce itself is a bit too bland to cover up the odd taste of the pasta itself (which said pasta stubbornly refuses to stay on the fork).  And even if you enjoy the meal, you'll only be able to do so for about five or six bites.  While the portion size may be the \"proper\" size for what people actually need, I don't think that most people, especially men, will find the portion size satisfying or hunger abating for long (although, to be fair, it's no smaller than most such single-serving microwave meals).Overall, I would have expected better from Barilla (which I swear by for most pasta needs), but if you're doing a working lunch and just need to get some quick sustenance, this will do as well as anything.

      "Corresponding review: Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is excellent, but I still do not consider it worthy of the title of \"one of the best Buffy seasons\" because it simply isn't. For a start there are a total of 12 episodes in Season 1 compared to the 22 in all the other Buffy seasons. Secondly, there isn't a lot of character development, most of which comes later on in the splendid Season 2. Thirdly, 20th Century Fox gave Joss Whedon a limited budget on which to film 12 episodes, making most episodes rather poor in sound quality, picture quality and special effects. Despite these few let-downs the season in terms of scripts, humour and character personality is absolutely excellent. Anyway, I'll get on with my review...Season 1 starts with a brilliant two-parter season opener in the form of Welcome To The Hellmouth and The Harvest. Both episodes were first broadcast on March 10th 1997 in the US to great critical acclaim. Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her mum Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) have moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, California. Buffy \"fell in with the wrong crowd\" and burned down the gym. What everyone doesn't know is that Buffy was trying to kill some vampires; she found out she was to be the Slayer before coming to Sunnydale. Figuring her Slaying days are far behind her, she hopes to make a fresh start at Sunnydale High School. On her first day, she makes friends with Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) - a nerdy, unpopular, computer whizz-kid with a heart of gold and a personality to make anyone who encounters her turn to slush! She also meets Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) who is the best friend of Willow. She is also introduced to Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who is kind to her on her first day at school. \"If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time,\" she proudly states to Buffy. It's clear that Cordelia is obssessed with being popular and loved by everyone. But after Cordelia sees Buffy hanging around with Willow and Xander, she turns on her - spreading rumors about her that last up until the end of the season. Buffy also meets up with the school librarian, Mr Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) who has secretly been sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher's Council in England to be the Watcher of a new Slayer. To Buffy, he's annoying - \"a textbook with arms.\" He knows Buffy is the Slayer, yet she won't accept this. \"Yeah, and I've both been there and done that and I'm moving on,\" she says. After Willow is snatched by a vampire, Buffy knows she must find her. Her Slayer instincts are instantly stirred and from then on, she realises being the Slayer is her duty. From then on, Buffy and the Scooby Gang (Willow/Xander/Giles) hunt the demons and vampires. Other top episodes include Witch, Teacher's Pet, The Pack, Angel, Nightmares and Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight. All the episodes have fantastic dialogue, witty one-liners and exciting storylines. This perfect combination is very hard to get right, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to get it spot-on.The seasons' main story arc focuses on the vampire legend, as does the second season. Yet Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 6 didn't really focus on Big Bad's of the non-vampire variety. The Master (Mark Metcalf) is a very powerful vampire that is stuck in between Hell and Earth who is desperate to get free and rule over the world. He makes many attempts to get free in episodes such as The Harvest, Never Kill A Boy On The First Date among others. In the season opener, we meet Angel (David Boreanaz). For the first seven episodes he is know by the Scooby Gang as Mysterious Guy. He's never around through the day, has pale skin and seems to know a lot about vampires - some would say a little to much. In the episode Angel, Buffy finds out he's a vampire. The one guy she's had a crush on is a vampire. Angel is a vampire with a soul and hasn't killed a human for years since his soul was restored. Amazingly, the two start to see each other in Season 2 but for Season 1 they mainly work together with Willow, Xander and Giles. In the episode I, Robot...You Jane, we are introduced to Jenny Calendar. She is an I.T. teacher at Sunnydale High School and features in the season finale Prophecy Girl. In the fianle, the Master is freed from his prison between Hell and Earth. Buffy and the Scoobies spend the most of the season looking for where the Hellmouth is - they realise the Hellmouth is situated directly underneath the School Libary. So Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia and Ms Calendar work together in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination to save the day...OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is essential for every fan. This TV show is legendary and these 12 episodes are absolute gems for everyone to treasure. The episodes are brilliant and you can watch them over and over again.

      "Corresponding review: From page one until almost the last, this story impressed me on many levels--As a writer, I was impressed and envious that a first novel could be SO good.As a reader, I fell in love with the voices of the book's 3 main characters--Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny--and never wanted their story to end.As a human being, the stories of black servants and their white employers in 1960s Mississippi alternately wrenched my heart and created a bitter knot in my stomach.  As a white person, the attitudes of (most of) the white characters in this story are an embarassment to me.  I know it's just a novel, but I also know (even with not having lived any further south than Virginia) that these attitudes are not fiction.The bond between Aibileen and Mae Mobley, one of the two white children she cared for, was beautifully drawn, as was Aibileen's hope for MaeMo to grow up a different kind of white woman than her mother and most other white women who inhabit the story.The balance these characters had to dance between wanting to do something that felt RIGHT--something that mattered and might help the next generation have a better life--and the fear of doing so in that racially explosive time and place was palpable throughout much of the story.In the last half of the book, I was reading while watching TV--something I don't think I've EVER done before--reading during commercials, reading in bed, reading on the porch...I felt that I HAD to keep reading.  Until the last chapter or two, I was absolutely convinced that I was going to give this book a 5-star review.  I was telling everyone I knew about it and recommending it heartily.But then came the ending, and I found it SO unsatisfying...especially compared to how incredibly satisfying I found the rest of the book.  I may be wrong, but it screamed one of two things to me--sequel or tight deadline; i.e., either things were left unfinished because there's going to be another book or she ran out of time to bring it to the complete, fulfilling and heart-gladdening ending that this amazing story deserved.I still very much recommend the book; just perhaps not as enthusiastically as I would have 50, 100 or 400 pages ago.Edited 08/11/11 to add that I just came from seeing the movie version of The Help and I thought it was FABULOUS!  The movie's director and the book's author are friends since childhood, so I was very hopeful that he would do a good job bringing this wonderful story to the screen and, in my opinion, he has.  The acting is marvelous, especially from Viola Davis (Aibileen) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie).  If you loved this book, I think you'll love the movie too! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this.

      "Human answer: I saw this movie about a month ago\n",
      "Corresponding question: What does the movie have?\n",
      "Corresponding review: \"Brokeback Mountain\" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of \"Titanic\" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing. I am certain that this picture is very Oscar-worthy.I saw this movie about a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture. To say that it was the very best film that I have ever seen would simply trivialize it, because it is much more than just a movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: the novel won numerous literary awards and became a long standing international best seller\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The Book Thief (New York: Albert A. Knopf, 2007), a novel by Australian writer Markus Zusak, accomplished a rare feat for Holocaust literature: the novel won numerous literary awards and became a long-standing international best seller, including being on the New York Times best seller list for a record of 230 weeks. What&#8217;s even more surprising about the novel&#8217;s success is not only its somber theme, but also the fact it&#8217;s a work of literary fiction (as opposed to genre fiction), a style of writing that rarely becomes a mainstream hit. Although the distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction is not cut-and-dry&#8212;for instance, Elizabeth Kostova&#8217;s novel, The Historian, fits both genres--I&#8217;d say that genre fiction places emphasis upon a fast-moving, interesting plot, while literary fiction privileges psychologically nuanced characterizations and a unique narrative style.Death characterized the Holocaust, and Death is the real narrator of the novel, which begins with the heroine&#8217;s end: Liesel Meminger&#8217;s death, many years after WWII, after she&#8217;s lived a full life and had children and grandchildren of her own. As Death carries the elderly woman&#8217;s soul to the other side, it also takes and narrates her childhood diary.In the late 1930&#8217;s and early 40&#8217;s, Liesel is a young adopted girl living in Germany. She has her first encounter with Death when her brother, Werner Meminger, who is also given up for adoption along with her, dies on the train to Molching. He&#8217;s buried by the railway station. That day, Liesel&#8217;s obsession with books&#8212;and death--begins. She picks up The Grave Digger&#8217;s Handbook, a book dropped by the funeral director at her brother&#8217;s funeral.Shortly thereafter, the distraught girl joins what might be seen as a typical German family, with whom she bonds quickly. Liesel&#8217;s adoptive father, Hans Hubermann, is a loyal German, who served during WWI, but is not sympathetic to the Nazi regime. Despite his reservations, Hans is enlisted in the German army during WWII. Artistic and sensitive&#8212;a painter and accordion player--Hans probably characterizes the attitude of a vast majority of Germans who were not anti-Semitic yet were forced to participate in the Nazi regime. His wife, Rosa, is a no-nonsense woman with a sharp tongue and a loving heart. She washes people&#8217;s clothes to supplement their income but gradually, one by one, her customers fire her.Liesel also meets Max Vandenburg, a Jew hidden by the Hubermann family from the Nazis, whose father fought during WWI alongside Hans Hubermann. Liesel befriends him. When Hans becomes ill, she reads to him. He eventually recovers, in part, the novel suggests, because of the power of friendship transmitted through the act of reading. Liesel and her family have a close call with the Gestapo, as soldiers search their house to see if they can use their basement as a shelter. Fortunately, they deem it too shallow and they leave.In all respects, Liesel blends in with her adoptive family. Their hardships and struggles become hers as well. She becomes especially close friends with Rudy Steiner, a blond &#8220;Aryan&#8221; boy a few months older than her, who develops a crush on her. Although the girl refuses to kiss him, together they embark on many adventures, which bond them to one another. Together, they become book thieves when the Mayor and his wife also fire Rosa. Their love of books and of the forbidden, representing a kind of protest against the Nazi regime and against injustice in life in general, binds the two children even more.Perhaps the strongest character of the novel is Death itself, its main narrator. Death may be brought about by war and by the savage murders perpetrated by the Nazis, but it is not sympathetic to them. Rather, Zusak depicts Death as a kind of Humanist, philosophical character: humane and disapproving of senseless violence, hatred and destruction. In parts, Death touches upon the comic and the absurd, needing &#8220;a vacation&#8221; from its job during the war.I think the strength of this novel lies in its complex characterizations: the German characters in particular are nuanced and multifaceted, not stereotyped in any way. They too struggle with the evils perpetrated by the Nazi regime and try to help victims, as much as they can. In the end, however, they too become victims of Hitler&#8217;s war, as Rosa, Hans and Rudy all die when the Hubermann house is bombed. Rudy doesn&#8217;t even get to experience Liesel&#8217;s first kiss, dying seconds before she finally declares her love for him and kisses him. Only Liesel survives and gets the chance to have a full life.If I were to identify any weakness in the novel it would be in the narrative style. Since style functions as a kind of author&#8217;s unique fingerprint in literary fiction, it&#8217;s largely dependent upon each reader&#8217;s subjective taste. The choppy, short sentences and disjointed, subjective structure of the novel weren&#8217;t to my personal taste, particularly since I usually look for a dense, sweeping and well-informed description of lived history in Holocaust literature. This novel, however, is impressionistic in both style and structure. But these stylistic features also made The Book Thief popular with readers of all ages, particularly with young readers, who could identify with the characters and appreciate its accessible form. Due to its literary success, The Book Thief was recently made into a movie directed by Brian Percival, released in November 2013. The movie, however, unlike the book, received mixed reviews.Claudia Moscovici, Literature Salon ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the quality of the blend?\n",
      "Corresponding review: For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything \"vanilla,\" I decided to tryStarbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). With this special blend, Starbucks promises \"a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma.\"I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say \"Thanks,\" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the \"subtleness\" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! \"Wow,\" I thought, \"this is real coffee!\" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review. I'm sitting here sniffing like a kid breathing in the aroma of a newly-baked cake. How's that for indulgence. :-)Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 10, 2010Author of \"Millennium Babe: The Prophecy,\" \"Dream Reachers\" (with Chase Von) and other books ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I have two points to make for the sake of full disclosure before actually writing a review of these headphones. First off, I received a free pair of the M6P headphones in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will do my best to deliver on my end of the bargain, with a review written for those wondering if they should spend their hard-earned money on the M6P. Secondly, I have never been an in-ear headphone person. I've used plenty of in-ear headphones in my day, but I have always preferred over-ear headsets as I find them to be, nine out of ten times, much more comfortable and high quality in their sound. That been said, I have been massively impressed by these headphones so far. Let's get to it then, shall we?As with any headphones, primary concern for me is sound. How does the M6P fare in that regard? Surprisingly well. I have never owned a pair of in-ear headphones that has had such a good sound range as these do. Usually, this sort of headset is severely lacking in bass and lower-mid tones, but the M6P has a genuinely fantastic range. Of course, the bass isn't quite what you'd get with over-ear phones, but honestly, it sounds pretty great. A little adjustment to equalization settings is all it takes for it to sound the way I like. Highs, mids, and lows are all  distinct and clear, with no one aspect overpowering the others. I've really enjoyed my time with the M6P so far. They also look pretty cool. I got the \"clear\" option, and it's got a nice clean science fiction look to it. I like it.The M6P has several features that are worth noting as well. The last three or so inches of cords that go into the headphones themselves are made of a much stiffer material than the rest of the cord is. This \"memory wire\" is there is so you can mold them around your ear, making these headphones perfect to use while exercising or working. I have a physical job that allows me to listen to music while working, and these headphones have been incredibly nice for that. They rarely jostle or fall out. If you're looking for a good set of headphones for use while working out, these are ones I'd give serious consideration. The M6P also has an inline universal control that has a surprisingly large variety of uses for only having a single button, a volume slider, and a built-in microphone. The volume slider is incredibly nice as you don't have to fight to get your iPod/Mp3 player out of your pocket to adjust the volume. Same goes for the single button, which can be use for playing/pausing music and even skipping or restarting tracks depending on how you press it. The mic works pretty well for phone calls too. Overall, the inline universal control is a pretty convenient feature I rather appreciated. It's a pretty high-end feature that I've never had on any in-ear headphones before.The M6P comes in an attractive little box with plenty of accessories in addition to the headphones themselves. There's a really small zip-up case that carries other things in addition to the headphones. There's a really nice folded up users manual that is very helpful in getting acquainted with the product and its various features. There's also a small zip-lock baggy with several different types of rubbery ear tips you can switch out if the default ear-tips don't suit your fancy. I really appreciated the extra ear-tips, as each of the six pairs pretty much guarantees that, no matter what your ears are shaped like, you will be able to enjoy these headphones comfortably. That's great. There's also a little clip that can be used to attach the phones into your shirt or whatever, which is a nice feature that helps keep the pressure off your ears if the cord gets tugged a bit. Overall, a nice package.Truly, these are great headphones, but they're not without some quirks to consider. The memory wire, as great as it is for keeping the phones in your ears, makes it so the headphones take longer to put in than others would be. Once you put the earbuds in your ears, you'll want to make sure you won't need to take them out for a little while. I also found the memory wire a pain to struggle with right out of the box until they had broken in. The memory wire on the right-earbud on mine were particularly stubborn for a little while. Once broken in, however, the memory wire is very easy to make conform to your ears and wroks great. Finally, and this is admittedly a nitpicky gripe, I don't care for the plug-in jack myself. It is angled at 90', with an L-shape. I prefer straight plug-ins for headphones, but that's just my preference, and doesn't really take the quality of the phones down at all. None of these are issues that would keep me away from the M6P, mind you, but they are quirks to keep in mind.All things considered, these are fantastic headphones. I've been supremely surprised by their high quality in comparison to all the other in-ear headphones I've owned. I have friends with high-end in-ear headsets that were twice the price (or higher) as these, but in my opinion, the M6P is much higher quality in terms of sound and has a much more robust feature set. These are a pretty awesome deal at $40! It appears you can get them for even cheaper than that on Amazon too, which astounds me. I'd definitely give these a hearty recommendation at this price. They're a great set of headphones. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I received a free container of this product to try. To test it I waited until the weather turned cold & my skin began to feel dry. To test it, I used this product on left leg & arm, and Sebamed moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin on right arm & leg.  I applied these products once a day - before bedtime, for 3days. At the end of this test both sides of my body felt equally moisturized.Pros of Viva Labs product- it will definitely last longer than a lotion moisturizer & lack of multiple ingredients reduces risk that your skin may react to it.Cons- it comes in a tub & it takes some patience to apply because the product is hard until the warmth of your fingers melts the top layer. It of course made my body smell like coconut, but in the morning the smell had declined enough that I don't think anyone standing near me would notice. Finally, I usually avoid any skin product that comes in a tub because each time you put your fingers in it you are transferring bacteria into it. I am not a chemist & don't know if harmful types of bacteria are likely to multiply in coconut oil.If you favor organic products or skin care products without a lot of chemicals, & if you are not allergic to coconut, this seems like a good option.  And of course, if you have a partner or spouse at home, make sure she or he is okay with the smell of coconut! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The slots on the inside of the case ensure that the iPad doesn't move while in those positions.The quality of the leather is good and looks very professional.The case seems very durable and I feel like it provides good protection for the ipad.The surface is completely open because the plastic backing fits snuggly around the sides.SmartCover works perfectly.The bad:The case was much thicker than I had expected. The reviews made it sound like it was very thin. I don't think it is that thin.The plastic case makes it harder to use the volume buttons, but I don't use them all that often.I don't like the way that the case/cover unfolds to the point where half the bottom is detached. In other words, if you lift the ipad by holding the cover, the back/bottom doesn't have much support.For the price, I would have shopped around more.

      "Corresponding question: How is the taste?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called \"honeybush,\" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.

      "Corresponding review: More of a story about a crime drama than a crime drama itself, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" follows a journalist sucked into a strange proposition to discover the secrets behind a decades-old suspected murder that took place in the middle of a highly dysfunctional family gathering.The book is set in Sweden and for an American reader, the Swedish proper nouns (towns/people) were a bit tough to follow, particularly in the context of trying to keep details straight for what I thought was a crime drama. It turns out those details aren't terribly necessary to the story (whose over-detailed nature seems to be a subject of some criticism), so just reading through casually was a better idea.For my taste, the book was a bit long and tedious in the first half, although it definitely picked up towards the middle and was quite exciting through the conclusion.Be warned that the subject matter contains some violence, including rape, incest, and battery of women. It isn't overly graphic, but the subject matter could definitely be disturbing for some.All in all it was an interesting read. I'd recommend reading it as a story rather than a crime drama, in as much as tracking all of the details and trying to solve the crime as a reader was a detriment to the first bit of the book for me. But reading it casually provided an interesting story with plenty of excitement towards the end. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Blaze is on fiyaaaaah, and I'm very sorry to have to be the 2102301310th person to make that joke.  But trust me, it's true.When a good friend recommended this place to me and insisted on treating me to a Blaze Pizza, I was immediately skeptical.  I have a pretty strong theory that you can only have 2 out of 3 things from any dining establishment located in close proximity to Dundas Square: 1) Quality  2) Affordability  3) Great customer service.  Well, colour me impressed - Blaze meets and exceeds all 3 criteria. Yes, you really *can* have your cake (or rather, pie) here and eat it too!  On my first visit, I was greeted by the friendliest staff that took the time to efficiently explain to me how Blaze works. A basic rundown: You can get a personal pie that is thin-crust, load it up with unlimited toppings (yes, unlimited! I basically had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming) at a set price, and watch it get fast-fired in a large fire oven in 180-ish seconds.The Good: HUGE shout outs to Alca, who deserves a promotion and unlimited pizzas forever and more!  For me, Alca is the face of Blaze Pizza - she's been there every time I've visited (so, a lot), and every time, she greets each customer with patience, enthusiasm and a smile.  She gave me a great impression of the place from the start - it's so refreshing to see someone who genuinely enjoys their job, and Alca brings such warmth to Blaze with her welcoming, upbeat attitude and contagious laughter. She even remembers regulars' names, which, considering the amount of customers Blaze gets, must not be an easy feat!  Big thanks to Alca for being a role model for what every server in Toronto should be like.  When I say Blaze has great customer service, I have Alca in mind. :)  Definitely greet her with a smile the next time you see her - she's awesome!-They don't skimp on their topics. The unlimited toppings here are really high quality, and would usually add up to a lot in any other pizza joint.  From an assortment of fresh veggies and basic ingredients to things like pesto, artichokes, arugala (!), chopped garlic, and cloves of roasted garlic (my favourite), this place has almost everything and something for every palette.  -Blaze is really, really fast.  I sometimes stare in wonder and amazement at the guy blazin' up those pizzas. It's an art, and the man does it with such diligence - I've always had my pizzas from here come out fast, crisp, and perfectly toasted, never burnt or overdone or underdone. They've got it down to a science here!-Unlimited drink refills (which Alca was kind enough to tell me!)  I never thought lemonade could pair well with pizza, but I was wrong. It's a genius pairing.-*TIP*: You can get the best of both worlds if you can't decide between pesto or red sauce!  I like to go half-and-half. You can customize the pie any way you want, so you get to try (and enjoy) a bit of everything.-They have to-go boxes, and unlimited parmesan, hot pepper flakes, and oregano/basil (I can't remember which) on the side for you to grab and load up your pizza with when you sit down.-They also have take-out boxes on the side that you can grab if you choose to have your pizza indoors, and don't finish it! (In that case, though, what's wrong with you...just kidding. I think the whole accessible just-in-case take-out box concept is great and pretty innovative.)The Bad: Sometimes, it can get a little busy and seating can be limited (I've never experienced it personally, but my dad goes regularly during lunch rush hour and tells me this is the case.) My trick is, if you really want a seat and it's too packed at Blaze during lunchtime, take your pie up to the foodcourt in the adjacent building, the floor right below the movie theatres. Grab a drink or something from there, and enjoy. There's usually plenty of seating in the food court and it's just a one minute walk/elevator ride away.The Ugly: Nada. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: When I first became aware of Quiet, I knew it was a book I had to read.  I've always been an introvert, content to curl up with a book for hours and wary of crowded places and loud parties.  Yet, even though I was aware of my introversion, I don't think I really understood it and what it meant.  I always saw it as a sort of flexible personality trait that I could change if I wanted to, and I always had the sense that there was something unhealthy about my particular personality type.  After reading the book, I feel I have a much better understanding not only of myself, but of how the way American society is structured tends to work against someone like me.Cain uses a blend of some of the latest neurological research and years of psychiatric studies to show why introverts and extroverts are so different, and to lay rest to the idea that there's something broken in people who don't meet the gregarious, outgoing American ideal.  The neuroscience she highlights in the book is easily understandable to the layperson, and shows how the brains of introverts and extroverts process stimuli differently.  Quite literally, extroverts' brains function in such a way that they are exhilarated and recharged by plenty of social stimulation while introverts need quiet and downtime in order to recharge.Using this research, Cain then shows why so many aspects of modern American life are doing few favors for introverts and, in fact, may be hindering creativity and innovation overall.  One of the topics she discusses is the seemingly ubiquitous open-plan workspace.  Having spent some years in offices, I could feel myself recoil as soon as she began touching on the topic.  The idea behind these plans is that an open atmosphere will create more interaction between employees, thus stimulating creativity and helping to further develop ideas.  This goes hand-in-hand with the corporate love of brainstorming sessions and leadership retreats, all of which I've had the misfortune of attending.  However, as Cain shows, all of these things actually hinder creativity.  People are at their most creative when they have quiet time alone in which to let their mind roam freely.  This is a topic of particular interest to me, and there are plenty of sources that support this conclusion.  Some companies are beginning to recognize this problem and are starting to design offices that provide spaces where people can retreat for some quiet thought and reflection.  This is a boon not only to the introverts, who really need these spaces, but to the extroverts as well because these more thoughtfully designed spaces offer all personality types the opportunity to seek out stimulation when they need it and to retreat into privacy when they need time for quiet thought.Another point that I found particularly interesting was Cain's examination of current educational philosophies.  I'm a former high/middle school teacher and the parent of an elementary-aged child, so I've had the chance to see this in action--not to mention the styles and philosophies with which I was presented during my teacher training.  There currently is a HUGE emphasis on group work, which I think can be attributed to the corporatization of education.  Despite that I am, myself, an introvert, as a teacher, I bought into the idea that kids need to be constantly interacting, but Cain points out the flaws in this idea.  Both my colleagues and myself were sometimes guilty of the \"Johnny is a great student but so quiet--if only he'd talk more!\" syndrome, and this book made me realize how harmful that can actually be.  While there is emphasis in modern education on learning styles--the visual learner versus the auditory learner, for example--there is next to no emphasis on how to appeal to various personality types.  I volunteer in my daughter's school, and every year the kids' desks are arranged in groupings, so that students spend a large amount of their time working with other students.  Still, there is a bright spot in that they are occasionally granted small stretches of time during which they're free to retreat to whatever part of their classroom or the outside pod area they like so they may complete an assignment.  Quiet really made me think about how important these opportunities are, and how they need to become a more integral part of the educational system.Most valuable of all, though, this book really made me think deeply about myself and those I love and to think of ways to better interact with them.  I have a better understand now of how what seemed pliable personality traits are actually inherent in me, and how I can work with them instead of against them so that I can alleviate stress and avoid feeling overwhelmed and burned out.  While the book is primarily about introverts, it also helped me to gain a better understanding about the extroverts in my life and how we can live more harmoniously with one another.  The sections of the book that deal with married couples was particularly interesting in this respect, because they showed how our own biases make us judge the reactions of others.  Since we tend to see the world through a certain lens, we sometimes have trouble understanding that not everyone thinks the way we do, and that we may be taking their reactions and misunderstanding them.  This is truly invaluable because I realize that by taking a more thoughtful approach to interactions with others, I can better understand not only my actions but theirs, which will hopefully lead to a better level of understanding between us.Quiet is a book I would recommend to anyone, regardless of whether you're an introvert or an extrovert.  I think that introverts like myself will feel better about our personalities and will see that the way we operate can be a strength rather than a social liability, as many of us have been conditioned to believe.  And I think that extroverts can learn that introverts aren't necessarily socially backwards or cold, but people who often feel awkward in our own skins because we see and admire the outgoing traits of extroverts but may have trouble emulating them.  This book simply works on so many levels: from the corporate world to the world of education and right on down to a personal level. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I use this with my Nikon D7000 and an off label battery.  This grip fits perfect, feels good in your hands, is exactly compatible with my camera, and looks just like the Nikon grip.  The wheel that you use to tighten works fine, but you can jiggle it back and forth.  This does not affect how it fits at all.  It doesn't mean that the grip is coming loose, its just how it is. It comes with an optional insert for AA batteries if you don't happen to have a second lithium battery charged.  I also like how it has the shutter button, AE-L/FE-L button, and front and rear dials as well as directional buttons to control the menus while the camera is vertical.I honestly did not know if it would be a fully compatible grip for that price but I was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality yet inexpensive grip.  It really gives your camera a professional look. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Is the parking fee expensive?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Stayed here for July 4th weekend, 2008. Hotel is 4 story building, conveniently located right by Fisherman's Wharf. At check-in, they placed me in 4th floor King bed room. Decor is colorful and fun. Room included a 42 inch LCD tv and even offered a few HD channels. Parking was expensive at $43/night but that is pretty standard in cities like San Francisco. We were able to walk a couple blocks to get to Fisherman's Wharf - a great area to stroll around and browse the various seafood, shops, and views off the piers. We were able to get to Chinatown with a 15 minute walk. The two things I loved about this hotel - the breakfast buffet and the outdoor firepits. Outside there are several semi-private sitting areas, each of which included a firepit. We bought a bottle of wine and just chilled outside, a fantastic and cozy way to finish off the night. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was pleasantly surprising. They offered small personal frypans with cooked veggie omelettes and home fries. My gf got a strawberry yogurt parfait while I was scooping up the salmon lox with capers. There was plenty of the standard continental fare in addition to the fresh mixed fruits. We had two complimentary passes but I saw from the menu it was rather expensive at $22+ per person. I would recommend based on value, location, and the firepits! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the cell phone screen?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Don't get me wrong, I love my e-ink kindle to death. It's served me well these past few years, but getting a Kindle Fire HD has opened up a bigger world of applications.For one thing, I can stream both Netflix and Pandora, which helps me on my personal and professional side projects quite a bit (I co-host several podcasts and radio shows based on entertainment like movies, books, and television).For another, I can finally take advantage of the electronic delivery of graphic novels, I feature I really love now that I've upgraded. The interface takes a few tries to get used to, as I'm a newbie to touchscreen interfaces, but it's pretty intuitive.It's also nice to have access to all of those casual gaming apps that most folks get on their smartphones. While Angry Birds has a somewhat limited appeal to me (I only got the Star Wars version), I'm really addicted to the Perry the Platypus game and look forward to trying out the Plants vs. Zombies port (I have the PC version and want to try out the tablet one).Now, I do have a few complaints, but none of them are big enough to drop it down from 5 stars.First, sometimes the typing interface and autocorrect can be glitchy. I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire... I just recommend to anyone considering it that they research both the wifi and the 4G options before purchase to see which option appeals to them more. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Very impressive VR works well.Very simple, easy to use interface.Great value at current pricing.Sleek, compact design.Screen is bright and easy to read.Free map updates (within 60 days of first use)Software updated to fix issues recently. (v4.70)FM transmitter -- though depends on your car.  Also has audio out/headphone jack.Can download lots of freebies like new voices, new vehicles, games, and so on.  (Some of the games aren't too bad.)Useful Pedestrian mode and \"last location\" feature (where did I park my car?), off road (find your way back to car after hunting/hiking in woods) and so on.Can optimize multi-stop routes for speed and efficiency (would be great for deliveries, for example).On board HELP.Cons:No printed manual.  Garmin can't include a proper printed manual?  Shame. They included plenty of color advertising brochures, cards, and such.No A/C adapter (optional extra) -- but you can use most any A/C to USB adapter.Even with latest map update, some new businesses in my area and a large development site not listed.Remarks:I just got my 855 and am quite happy with it.  I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no \"training\" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to \"Zoom In\" and \"Zoom Out\" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say \"Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant\" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and \"Go!\" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing.  Battery power is good (3-4 hours) and the ability to pop the unit out of the cradle and take with you to use on foot (think hiking, hunting, parks, large malls, etc.) and the  \"find my car\" feature are nice pluses.  The \"Where am I?\" is also a very easy and useful way to add locations to your favorites list.I'll come back and add more after I've had more time using the unit.  Some more comments and tips below.  [If you find this review useful, please click on the \"Was this review helpful to you?\" Yes (or No) below and feel free to leave a comment or ask a question.  I'll do my best to answer those that I can. Thanks!]Comments:Found satellites and had good location within five minutes right out of the box in my family room.  Good receiver.Replaceable battery!  Can buy additional spares if needed (hiking, for example).VR works right off the bat - no \"training\" required.  Very accurate in my experience so far. (No VR system is perfect.)Free Voice Studio software allows you to record your own voice prompts!  I can see mischievous minds at work already. ;)Fast route calculations -- overall pretty snappy and accurateGood \"MyGarmin\" web site with lots of extras, FAQs and support info.Has jack for an external GPS antenna/receiver, though I doubt you'll ever need it.  Might be helpful in some trucks.On screen touch keyboard works well and is easy to use.Lets you easily create and save routes at home before your trip!  Some units I've had made this very difficult.  Very nice feature that is simple and easy to use.  Can save up to 10 Routes, each route can have multiple destinations and via points.  Shows you distance and time of travel for each route saved.  Very flexible.  The 855 will optimize routes so you visit destinations in the most efficient order.  Kudos, Garmin!Has on board HELPTips:-- Audio out/headphone jack provide an alternate way to get audio.  Can use external powered speakers, for example.  Many new cars have an audio in jack which will give better sound than via FM transmitter.  I tried using a cassette adapter (such as used to play mp3's via car radio) plugged into headphone/audio out jack and it worked very well.-- I tried various A/C USB chargers and all worked fine.  At first unit will go into \"PC connected\" mode, but if you wait 30 seconds or so, it will then switch to \"normal\" mode and you can use it as you normally would.  Will charge battery fine.  These chargers can be found for as little as $5 sometimes.-- You can press and hold battery icon to see more detailed information, such as per cent charged and even core temps. (Diagnostic display)-- I saw a tip somewhere online on how to adjust the internal mike gain to improve VR by decreasing the sensitivity to background noise.  Will update later on this,-- While at home, you can easily set/save the location in favorites as \"Home\" (Overcomes common problem of house number locations being a bit off, which affects all GPS units, by the way.)-- Amazon camera case (item No. ??? , insert link) fits this unit perfectly and has belt loop for easy carry. (Will update this info later.)-- Cancel VR button on remote works as \"back\" button on menus, too.-- Use 128 CBR mp3's (constant bit rate) for best results.-- Minimize background noises when using VR for best results.  (True with most VR gear.)-- After you do the map update, you still need to go to myGramin dashboard and check for the new software update.  Follow the instructions very carefully.  Takes awhile, but it works and will verify the update once done.-- You can fold a paper plate to make a bonnet to shield unit from sun (heat) ad make the display easier to read in bright sunlight (though I had no problems with this).  Heat may be causing some of the lockups others here have experienced.  (Punch holes and use rubber band to secure.)-  In cases where a city or street name can not be understood, use the 'spell' option in VR mode and spell the name.8/5/2010 Update:  Used this on a road trip this past weekend (200 miles) and it performed very well.  So I can verify a few more things:1)  Extremely fast recalculations if you deviate from the planned route.  So fast, you might not even notice it.  Fastest of any unit I have used.2)  Very fast satellite lock when you stop (i.e. turn off the car and GPS) and restart.  It will be ready before you are!3)  I used the VR extensively and it worked very, very well.  I had no problems even with the radio on (low) and some noise in the car.  Yes, a sharp or loud background noise might cause you to have to repeat a command now and then, but this actually happened only rarely.  Most of the time, it simply worked.  I have not seen any other GPS with VR this good and this complete (in terms of supported functions).  This was the most important feature for me and I am very pleased with it.  You can truly use this GPS hands free nearly all of the time.  And most importantly, *all* the functions you need while driving are supported. (Like zooming, accessing turn info, searching for POI's and so on.)4)  This trip was one I have taken many times, so I know the various routes pretty well.  I like to drive down one way and come back a different way.  On the way back, it found a new, faster route on a tricky section.  At first, I thought it was misdirecting me, but when I checked and then followed the new route, it was indeed a bit shorter/faster than the way I normally go and on as good or better roads.5)  The estimated arrival times were right on the money.6)  I used the built-in speakers most of the time and they were loud enough for me.7)  Very easy to use, no problems or issues.  The only other GPS I've used this good cost twice as much. Excellent at the main job of getting you where you want to go. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Human answer: Tracy Chevalier\n",
      "Corresponding question: Where is your wife?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The shimmering city of Delft leaps from the pages of Tracy Chevalier's delicately descriptive novel onto the screen in the film 'Girl With a Pearl Earring'. 17th century Holland is recreated with breathtaking splendor. From the folds of the dresses to the attitudes of the day, the film stays in character and does not add Hollywood gimmicks to modernize the tale. Servants are servile and illiterate, though not necessarily unintelligent. The titular teenage maid does not have an insolent attitude.Scarlett Johansson plays the young Griet, the daughter of a former tile painter who is sent across town to serve the Vermeer household. Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a painter, is drawn to Griet's quiet loveliness. Though few words pass between them, their mutual eye for aesthetics develops into strong attraction and deep appreciation. Her pure complexion also attracts Vermeer's vulgar patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) and the young butcher Pieter (Cillian Murphy).Each frame is a painting within itself, supported by a charming score (though some have called the music obnoxious). Though every scene is beautiful, Griet's position is not romanticized; her arduous labor is evident throughout the movie. Instead of altering the story to conform to a 95 minute film, sections of the story are simply deleted or unexplained. Particularly the character of Tanneke is underdeveloped, compared to the book character.The acting is dramatic yet understated. Expressions are affectively portrayed without losing subtlety. Johansson expressively displays the young, almost timid side of Griet. Colin Firth is an attractive Vermeer; he has natural and exciting reactions. Tom Wilkinson is surprisingly low key as Van Ruijven, compared to the character in the novel; however, he still manages to be repulsive. Essie Davis's performance is also a standout as Vermeer's insecure wife, Catharina.'Girl With a Pearl Earring' establishes its setting in an unforgettable light, and the story has enough magic to satisfy the patient viewer. Might I add that Cillian Murphy is beautiful. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

So I did check with the mgr before I ordered, and she said yes they have the special, so I ordered thinking there's a special flat price for small, medium, and large.  For the total of 6 dishes I ordered, the bill including a 15 percent tip and tax was $40.  This gotta be the most expensive dim sum I have ever eaten lol!  ESP considering I don't have much left over and I didn't order a special kitchen dish like BBQ or fried noodle!  So for slight better in ingredient and taste, I would agree with fellow yelpers that this place is not worth it.  If u have lots of cash and would like the better ingredients and decent taste, then it's probably ok.

      "Corresponding review: Two decades ago my allergist told me to give up wheat, milk products, soy, yeast, citrus and sugar. I did and initially I lost weight. Eventually I gained it back. But yes, if you give up the most common foods in the western world, you will probably lose weight because you won't enjoy eating and you'll have difficulty finding ample quantities of food to eat. You'll become very focused (some would say obsessed) on what to eat and may lie awake at night thinking about it. You'll have to carry strong eyeglasses with you when you shop so your can decipher all the labels.Instead of the foods I started with, JJ Virgin lists 7 foods to drop: corn, eggs, peanuts, dairy, gluten, soy, and sugar (including artificial sweeteners).  You can do this IF you rarely eat out, avoid social events, and live in the right place. The right place is Southern California or some other warm climate where a variety of fresh foods is always available. Believe me, there are plenty of places where it is just about impossible to find decent veggies in the winter! I find myself standing in the produce section wrinkling my nose at the pitiful selection of bruised and past-ripe items. So I would wait until summer to try this diet.Except that I've been living with most of the restrictions for years. After the initial diagnosis of food allergies, I followed my doctor's instructions carefully but still had digestive problems. Eventually I learned that I could not tolerate peanuts or corn, plus most fruits, many spices, and a host of other items. So by the time I read the book I was already on her plan for the most part. I did eat eggs occasionally and I had added sugar back in because it is just too hard to avoid forever. Probably it would be easier in southern California, but here in rural Virginia the items available in stores are limited. Our health food stores are tiny and farmers markets are closed in the winter months.But enough whining! There are some good things about the book! It popularizes a list of common allergenic foods, and a number of people will discover allergies or intolerances from trying this diet. No doubt some readers have already gone gluten-free and given up wheat; it's kind of a fad right now. And Ms. Virgin is correct in cautioning us to be wary of gluten-free substitute foods because many of them are high in carbs and sugars.To her credit, she mentions in two places that the diet may not improve your symptoms if you have SIBO, candida, parasites, or \"poor digestion.\" I've had all those and indeed you should consult a medical practitioner to help sort out those conditions. However, I found some of her other assertions to be simplistic. So don't expect science here; this is more of a self-help book.I was put off by her claim that all of her clients were helped by this program. I imagine she is not counting the diet drop-outs and I'll bet there were more than a few! And I'd be interested in knowing how many people gained the weight back after a year or two.Still, if you are highly motivated and self-disciplined, you may very likely drop the promised 7 pounds, at least for now.  And you may discover that certain foods cause symptoms that you will be glad to put behind you.The book is easy to understand and attractively presented, at least in the hardcover edition. The fonts are readable and charts serve as illustrations. The clients' stories are repetitious but may help inspire you. So I give this an above-average rating in spite of my reservations about long-term results. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Is sugar enough?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says \"100% natural arabica\". Not sure what the \"natural\" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak \"natural\" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the \"arabica\" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

She hadn't seen  or touched a single human being for  3 years until Adam Kent was sent to be her cellmate. That's where the story began and I was hooked immediately, excited to know who the boy was, and his connection to Juliette. I was excited to know why The Reestablishment put Juliette in the institution and why they suddenly put a boy in her room. I loved how the story was written in such a way that it became even more effective to see what's in Juliette's head and the things she had been thinking and feeling and I hope I could see Adam in the same way.\"Of course I remember you.\" My voice strangled whisper. I squeeze my eyes shut. I remember you every day forever in every broken moment of my life. \"You were the only one who ever looked at me like a human being.\" - JulietteYou're going to love Adam Kent. It is always one of the things I look for in a story. A guy whom I can see myself rooting for. He's one of those sweet, sexy and dependable guy that you will put on your list of swoon-worthy book boyfriends that will make you fall in love over again. With a strong hero comes a strong heroine and a book is dull without them. Juliette is definitely one tough girl and I liked her because she has a good heart. I don't think I can describe Juliette in a more effective way than this, so I chose Adam's exact words as she said this words to her.\"A million times... I saw you do things like that a million times. But you never said a word unless it was forced out of you... You never asked for anything from anyone... But no one ever gave you a chance.\"  -AdamI always loved a character with goodness in their heart because they inspire me... to do good, to think right. Juliette is one of those heroines that I tend to love because of that. Not just a kick-ass, but also kind-hearted.What I liked most about this book is the love story and that the words were written beautifully and effectively. It was surprisingly good and refreshing since I didn't expected it to be some kind of superhero thing. I realized that Juliette actually reminds me of Rogue. I wonder if Tehereh Mafi is a fan of X-Men and if she, too (like me) is fascinated by Rogue. It was quite interesting and I am excited to see how the things will turn out in the next books.I loved everything about this book except for the world-building which I think is lacking. I hope that the author gave us a clear picture of the \"The Reestablishment\", the leaders, and the society. Dystopian novels is one of my favorite genre, and it's important (I think) that we are given a clear image of the dystopian world and what it takes to live in that horrific period. Other than that, this book is great in many ways.An engaging book like this with strong characters and amazing story line will win the hearts of readers who enjoy paranormal-dystopian novels with deliciously crafted romance. The whole story is gripping, the ending is satisfying, and the experience... shattering. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: These speakers ROCK. I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the \"sweet spot\" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of \"small\" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

A staff member came over and explained that you have to order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.After perusing the menu I took Sarah L.'s suggestion and went with the Curry Wvrst. I also went with the staff member's recco on lamb for the type of wvrst. I piled on some duck fat fries and topped it off with a pint of Weihstephaner.While I was waiting for my meal someone came over who identified himself as a photographer for the Toronto Star. He was doing a story on the restaurant and asked if I would move over to the next bench so he could include me in some of his shots. I gladly obliged.After a short wait my lunch arrived. The meal was delicious. I definitely recommend the curry. It was tomato-based which went well with the wvrst and the fries. The fries come with a dipping sauce so my choice naturally was the Wvrst sauce. It had a nice tang to it but wasn't as spicy as I would have liked. Overall a really great experience.

This deteriorated as the days went by and by the time I got back to the UK, the rash was covering my entire body including my face. Uncertain of what was happening to my body, I was in a great deal of distress fearing the worst.The rash was so itchy and so unsightly that I was obliged to cancel all my clinics ( I am a doctor) and research work. I saw a dermatologist who immediately and without any hesitation diagnosed bed bug bites. I believe that this is absolutely unacceptable and shocking!! Bed bug bites are known to be a source of transmission of Hepatitis B and Chagas disease which are both potentially fatal conditions. There have also been reports of death by anaphylactic shock in the unlucky few. However, what is even more appalling is that I have paid good money ($180/night) only to suffer this very horrific outcome which has caused me great distress and affected my productivity at the conference in San Francisco as well as affecting my work, my patients and my income. It has also essentially ruined what has been a very expensive and potentially rewarding trip to San Francisco.There is also a risk that the bed bugs may have been transported to my home in my suitcase with a hazard to all at home and a great deal of expense and hassle to eradicate.Phoned management who said they will get back to me but they haven't despite emailing them and also notifying them in the post.

This product however definitely deserves it.The router took about 10' to install and has worked like a charm since then. Positioned in the ground floor of the house, it manages to give a strong enough signal to be received at 135 Mbps from the upper floor. And that's from my net-book, which has a quite mediocre network card. My room-mate claims that he has a super high speed, both for downloading and for uploading, from his desktop computer.The router has a fairly easy menu, though it took us a good 7 minutes to configure all the security settings (you can never be too careful these days). Other routers may be better in this aspect. However, this is something you only do once (or twice at most) so it's not a big deal.The bottom line is that this product is not just a good buy, but something you can cherish for a while. I would highly recommend it to any computer user who relies a lot on a wireless network for his/her internet access.One thing that it is a bit bizarre though is that the upload speed is about 3 times higher than the download speed, something that has been observed it two computers in our network. Usually DL speed is significantly lower than UL speed. That's not an issue though, since the important factor is the connection stability, which has exceeded our expectations. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The third and final book in Suzanne Collins'sThe Hunger Gamestrilogy completes Katniss's story by taking her experiences to the next logical (and inevitable) step. In hindsight, the progression of the three-book storyline is obvious: Katniss goes from a tribute in a gladiatorial death-match, to getting caught up in the revolution that follows, to this: her participation in a full-scale war.Rescued from the arena at the conclusion ofCatching Fire, Katniss now finds herself recovering in District 13, a place long thought to have been destroyed by the Capitol, but in actuality existing as a vast underground complex. Her teammate and would-be love interest Peeta was not so lucky, for he was captured by the Capitol and is now being used as an instrument of propaganda by the sinister President Snow. Due to their home in District 12 being bombed, Katniss and other survivors/refugees from the mining community have joined forces with District 13's resistance fighters, though it would seem that their every act of kindness is hedged with self-interest.Katniss, her mother and sister, and her childhood friend Gale are moderately safe in the extensive underground bunkers of District 13, where schedules are tattooed in impermanent ink on everyone's arm each day and wasting food or other resources is tantamount to a criminal offense. Naturally, Katniss chaffs under the imposition of these strict rules, but luckily for her, she's got some leverage. Having made herself infamous through her actions in the Hunger Games, the resistance wants her to become a symbol of the uprising, using her status as the Mockingjay to unite the remaining eleven districts.She agrees, but not before laying down a few conditions of her own. It's at this point that we see Katniss finally become more aware of her own power as well as (paradoxically) her inherent helplessness. On the one hand, she's a valuable asset and thus has a certain amount of say in District 13's decision-making; on the other, District 13 is just as capable of manipulation, cruelty and exploitation as the Capitol, and Katniss sees firsthand the lengths to which they'll go to in order to destroy the totalitarian regime of President Snow and the Capitol. Can she be a part of it without compromising herself?Once again she finds herself in the Hunger Games - though of a slightly different sort this time. Now the cameras are trained on her as she visits hospitals, rallies the districts, and consoles her wounded compatriots. She's become a part of the propaganda machine, and struggles to maintain her own agency and personality in the progress. Clearly suffering from the first signs of PTSD (complete with concussions, drug-use, on-going injuries and nightmares) Katniss also struggles with the knowledge that everything she does to rile the Capitol may be putting the captive Peeta into danger.It all comes to a head in a nail-biting game of cat and mouse with in the streets of the Capitol itself, and in the climactic final gambit played out by Katniss.It was with interest that I read some of the other reviews for \"Mockingjay\", particularly the ones that gave it a lower rating. Notably, there seems to be a definite disconnect between what people were expecting, and what Collins delivered. Is this a dark but ultimately uplifting story about a girl who becomes a hero and leads a rebellion to victory at a large but ultimately necessary cost? Or is it a story about the effect that war and death have on young people, how both sides of the conflict can be morally grey, and how people have only so much strength in them before they break? It's the latter, but lot of people wanted the former, and it's clear that they're judging \"Mockingjay\" not on what it is, but what they wanted it to be. Naturally everyone will have a series of expectations whenever they crack open any book (especially one as anticipated as this one), but I also think that Collins had a specific message to impart, and ignoring it is to miss the very point of the trilogy.For example, Collins makes some very interesting storytelling decisions throughout. For the last two books President Snow has been set up as Katniss's primary antagonist; the ultimate foe that she will one day face (it's even foreshadowed in their names: Snow versus the Girl on Fire). Yet without giving too much away, their confrontation is not what you'd expect. Likewise, there is a rather unconventional resolution to the love triangle that many may not find satisfactory. Personally, I was never in any doubt as to which of the two boys Katniss would chose, but the way in which is occurs is hardly what you'd call a \"fairytale ending.\"However, there are some parts of \"Mockingjay\" where I can understand why readers were a bit disgruntled. The death toll is extremely high; I wasn't keeping count, but there's a good chance that more named characters (I'm including the minor ones in this) end up dead than the living. In this case, Collins's gift is also her curse: by creating characters that you care about so quickly and so deeply, it is gut-wrenching when several of them not only die, but do so in a swift and anti-climactic manner. Sure, she's trying to make a statement about the randomness of war, but it's hard not to think that some characters deserved more - if not their lives, than at least a meaningful death.Although the writing is still as strong as ever in terms of its pacing and clarity, there are times in which Collins trips up. About halfway through the book, Katniss sings a haunting (and highly symbolic) song called \"The Hanging Tree\". Instead of Collins simply leaving the reader to interpret its meaning, she has Katniss internally analysis it for the benefit of the reader (taking up two pages!), thus robbing it of all its mystery. There are a couple of times in which she breaks the \"show, don't tell\" rule, breaking down various situations instead of letting the reader figure it out for themselves. (Though ironically, the most crucial gambit that Katniss plays toward the end of the novel seems to have been *too* subtle, given that many readers have expressed confusion over it. Or maybe most readers are used to being spoon-fed answers, thus justifying Collins's early attempts to spell things out. Who knows). Yet Collins's strength in writing is still apparent: her ability to maintain a riveting pace, in which everything flows smoothly from chapter to chapter, and suspense builds as the story goes on.Having a dig around some of the other reviews, I was disappointed (though hardly surprised) at the criticisms leveled at Katniss's characterization. Generally speaking, it's immensely difficult to write female characters, especially protagonists, as they will always be held to a higher standard than male characters. If she's too competent, too loved, too successful, she'll be deemed a Mary Sue. If she's too flawed, too fallible, or makes too many mistakes, then she's a bad role model and an affront to feminism.It feels as though that's what happened here. Many wanted her to step up as a hero and take control of every situation. Others dismiss her as \"fickle\" or \"selfish\" due to her interactions with Peeta and Gale (claims that baffle me considering her devotion to her sister and willingness to die for others). Others think she spent too much time under sedation, or gunning people down, or making the wrong decisions; and of course, with so much attention placed on the love triangle (not so much in the book, but certainly in on-line fan discussions - one can't help but feel that Stephenie Meyer's endorsements drew in the Twilight crowd) there were inevitably going to be disappointed shippers who would accuse Katniss of making \"the wrong choice\" no matter what boy she chose. So what was she: too good to be true, or a disappointing female character?Actually, she was neither. She was a seventeen year old girl who goes through a devastating ordeal, and the crux of this trilogy is that the reader shares in her terror, her self-loathing, her mental collapse, and her gradual crawl back to some degree of normality. It's a grueling experience, but one that's unflinching in revealing the true cost of war.So thank you Suzanne Collins for giving me Katniss: a three-dimensional, fully developed character who was nothing like me, and yet who I could relate to completely. Sometimes she failed, sometimes she succeeded, but she's embroiled in a story that is complex without being convoluted, and which raises difficult questions about the world without providing any sort of simplistic answer. The character development reflects this, for Collins doesn't make it easy: not for Katniss and not for the reader, and in my opinion, this uncompromising storytelling makes the complete trilogy stronger as a result. Will it be a classic? Only time will tell, but were I to place money on it, my bet would be yes. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Human answer: it 's highly sensitive and easy to use\n",
      "Corresponding question: How do you like the keyboard?\n",
      "Corresponding review: As with most Microsoft products, great hardware, poor software, but oh well.Now I'm using this thing right now, and I never noticed the spacebar thing, but it's true, if you don't press the spacebar correctly and press it on the upper area, it's hard to press down. I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of \"My\" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The NT38B Airbender is revolutionary in iPad keyboard cases.  There truly are very few real competitors here.  This case's flexibility makes it a leader as it swivels, and detaches, allowing seemingly unlimited combinations of viewing and portability.  The set-up (the way it positions/stands) also allows rigidity for users who want to use the iPad like a laptop, with screen fixed upright in place.  Unlike most iPad cases which require you hold the unit still, or leave on a flat surface, the NT38B Airbender stays in position.  The case is also quite rugged.  As a tech guy, I've experienced many cases that promise to protect, but at the end of the day protect only from scratches.  This case is rugged, solid.  Another phenomenal option is the ability to easily detach the iPad from the keyboard while keeping the iPad in it's case.  The iPad then can stand alone in various positions while you type.  The battery is also quite reliable.  I've had the unit for weeks now and have not had to recharge yet.  Two items that could improve this product, which I have NOT seen in other \"like\" items:  grip surface on outside of case, and further improved keyboard experience.  Most iPad keyboards have the same issue: the keys do not tap as well as they do on a Macbook/laptop.  Overall, a SOLID product. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Because this is a small, sidewalk style restaurant, expect a line up stretching out the door.

Nor does the heart-throb image of Tom Cruise.Yes, Cruise's name sold the movie. However, his acting also carried it. Of all the films I have watched this year (and I have seen most of the Oscar contenders), this was the first time I actually thought to myself \"Wow. This guy is good.\" Tom Cruise is amazing in this film, as are the rest of the cast, most outstandingly Watanabe (Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka).To summarize: Cruise plays a post-civil war soldier who is hired by the Japenese Emperor as a battle advisor against the rebellions of the last remaining samurai. However, the American is taken hostage by the Samurai during a battle and soon befriends the Samurai village. The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.The battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing. The cinematography is wonderful. However, the actors, the themes, and the BREATHTAKING score carry the film to a superb quality deserving of the highest recognition.Deep down, it is a feel good movie.

I'm glad that I did.  I really enjoy this Fog Chaser variety, and the Subscribe & Save price (~$25 right now) is good for 80 cups these days.  Plus, they started including a plastic container in each 80-pack that you can store your pods in after you open up one of the eight-count bags.  I had already bought an air-tight container to keep them fresh (I originally just used zip-lock bags), but it's a nice touch.In my Breville brewer, these pods do take longer to make a cup than a regular K-Cup.  Maybe it's just my brewer, but perhaps there's more flow resistance in these.  Not a huge deal, but I thought it was worth mentioning.I'm not sure how much less plastic these have versus the original K-Cups.  They don't have the plastic cup, but the rim is a lot thicker plastic on these, and they come in plastic bags with a plastic container in each 80-pack.

Abby is a good girl trying to put some distance between her current and life and her dark past.  What Abby finds with Travis makes for a good love story, but I found that I both loved and hated these characters. Pulling the two together over a &#8220;bet&#8221; wasn&#8217;t as engaging as it could have been. I wasn&#8217;t really sure I appreciated their complicated attraction. The sexual tension that builds through the first half of the book is captivating, but I was not fond of how beating someone to a pulp was glamorized. The second half of book is a bit rushed, and I believe portrayed drinking and illegal fight clubs as hip. I can&#8217;t decide if their love story was truly beautiful, or like watching something so dysfunctional it is hard to look away. The story gets high marks for strong dialogue and fantastic supporting characters. This always brings life to the main characters. Even though I wasn&#8217;t fond of the way Travis and Abby meet, this is quality story-telling with a well-crafted plot. There is a great deal of passion and suspense which ignites interest.

      "Corresponding review: Online registration on their website was easy, and they offer a great discount. When we got there, someone came out right away to help us with our luggage. Check-in was a breeze, and the room was clean with a spectacular view of the city. We even got the type of room we had requested. What's even better is that they offer free breakfast, free WiFi, computer and printer use, six washers and four dryers (bring quarters), snack and soda machines, and the friendliest front desk staff 24/7. The location was great. The California and Powell cable cars are a block away so we bought the 3-day Muni pass for $18 ea. and caught the cable cars to get around. The weather was perfect and we ended up walking to Union Square several times and found some great restaurants along the way. The room has a kitchenette and refrigerator which were perfect for our leftovers and late night snacks. Even had a dining table and a comfortable couch. Loved this place! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: interface is incredibly smooth\n",
      "Human answer: There are some slight limitations to the device but that should n't stop you from purchasing this product\n",
      "Corresponding question: What a good selection for all their products?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The Roku 3 is the latest device that I've added to my home in an effort to replace my cable box. No, the Roku 3 by itself cannot replace all the functions of a cable box but it is a great place to start. The device, about the size of a hockey puck, is truly impressive and functions better than more expensive alternatives.---------------SETUP:From start to finish setup is incredibly easy. I got my Roku up and running in less than 5-minutes. Included in the box are quick-start instructions, the power adapter, the remote (with batteries), and the Roku device. I used a small piece of sticky back Velcro to adhere my Roku to the back of my HDTV, although there are other alternatives sold here on Amazon such as the TotalMount Roku Mounting Kit. The Roku is light enough that even double sided tape would hold the device firmly in place. The only piece you need outside the box is a HDMI cable. The Roku 3 accepts both wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi. I chose the latter and I'm happy to say that Wi-Fi works perfectly. The main reason I avoided the Roku products before the R3 model was because I'd heard complaints of spotty Wi-Fi. This is not the case at all with the Roku 3. My wireless router is in my basement on the other side of my home and the R3 easily picks up a strong signal and delivers content consistently without interruption.Once the device is connected to your television and internet you'll need a computer or internet-enabled device to connect to Roku's website and register the device. This is accomplished via a simple pin-code that you'll type into the website. Once that's accomplished you can start adding channels in addition to those already loaded on the device. For folks who already subscribers to services like Netflix or Amazon VoD you can proceed to sign in or in Amazon's case enable the device by following the on-screen instructions.---------------USE:My wife has been making extensive use of the device as we recently welcomed our first child and she uses the device while at home to stream television shows and movies. The interface is incredibly smooth and very refined. No unnecessary navigation or sub-menus are present. Apps like Netflix, Amazon VoD, Vudu, Hulu, etc. are very responsive and easy to navigate. Comparing the Roku 3 to another device we recently purchased, the Western Digital Live TV Hub is a landslide victory for Roku. Other companies will have to play catch-up to Roku's little device as it's very impressive.--------------What I Love About the Roku 3:(+) The remote is fantastic and doesn't require line-of-sight with the R3 box to operate.(+) The remote has a built-in jack that supports headphones/earbuds. This is a great feature for anyone with kids or poor noise insulation in their home and lets you watch programs without disturbing anyone else.(+) The interface is customizable featuring everything from themes to app tiles that can be changed and adjusted. Best of all, the entire interface isn't slow or clumsy. Button presses on the remote immediately translate to a response on-screen.(+) Universal search. Looking for specific movie or TV show but not sure if it's available on Netflix or Amazon? Universal search allows you to search available channels for your content.(+) The small and inconspicuous design is perfect in our living room where we keep our electronics footprint as light as possible. The R3 is very easy to hide and slim enough to fit behind my wall-mounted HDTV.(+) The quality of the streaming content is consistently superior on the Roku 3 than on a similar device, the Western Digital TV Live Hub. I'm not sure if it comes down to the processor or exactly what. I even have my WDTV Live Hub using a wired Ethernet connection and it still displays an inferior resolution to the R3.(+) Has a built-in USB port for connecting external hard-drives with additional content. Also included is a SD-expansion slot for storing content and additional channels.(+) Andriod/iOS app support that allows you to channel surf, change the channel, or display content from your smart phone on your TV.---------------What I Don't Love about My Roku 3:(-) Does not support non-HDTVs. The inclusion of only HDMI output means that only a suitable HDTV will work with the Roku 3. This is probably less relevant today than it would have been a few years ago but still something to consider for non-HDTV owners. The R3 does not come with a HDMI cable.(-) Limited support for external files. For movies .mkv (h.264) and mp4 (h.264) are supported but nothing else. Supported music file formats include .aac  and .mp3. For photos it's only .jpg and .png.(-) No YouTube channel.---------------Overall:The Roku 3 is a fantastic little device that opens up a world of content at your fingertips. The device is inexpensive yet extremely well refined and polished in a way very few other products in this market have achieved. There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product. Recommended.---------------UPDATE: 7/2/13: I've been using my Roku 3 for about 3 months and in that time the remote has lost its connection to the base unit twice. I've noticed that on both occasions the remote will suddenly stop responding to certain commands. For example all of the arrow keys and the 'OK' buttons will stop functioning but I can still use the 'back' button. The easiest solution I've found is to simply power off the base unit by unplugging the AC adapter, waiting a few seconds, and plugging the adapter back in. The R3 does come with a troubleshooting guide in the manual that covers pairing a remote with the base unit but it was unnecessary in my experience. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

TIP: If you're on a more casual date, grab seats at the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare the food - amazing experience.FOOD:- The raw bar is sublime and a specialty of the restaurant. If you can handle it, eat this.- ** the menu changes but there is usually a foie gras option and you should have it **- Have something truly Canadian as a main: Venison or Sturgeon for instance. There is usually something with maple also - do that!- Have a sweet Canadian wine with dessert (Inniskilin is a personal favorite) - and opt for one sweet and one cheese platter. You won't be disappointed.WINE: No words needed; this is one of the best wine lists around and you'll find what you want. Sommelier is also always helpful with choices and I'd leverage him/her if needed. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Not too salty like most other Ramen places. The pork was tasty as they pan fried it before putting it in the ramen to bring out it's flavor. The soft boiled egg (my favorite so I'm picky about how well its done) was perfect too! The soup was very good - measured up to the Ramen place I tried in Okinawa, Japan. Lastly, the noodles were also cooked to al dente! Amazing bowl of noodles! I've also tried the Zangi (fried chicken) before which is pretty good too! The touch of lemon to it is a great addition. So to reiterate: Best Ramen in Toronto!! You must try it!!! It is definitely worth the line up! Even in the Winter (which I've done) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Fruit, yogurts, bagels, cereals, bread for toasting, and instant oatmeal. They offer hot water, tea, and coffee all day long. Also a Mel''s diner that is 24 hours is connected to the hotel.

      "Corresponding review: I don't yet have a Wireless N router (probably later this year), so I cannot test the Wireless N speeds obtained this adapter, so you will need to check other reviews for that one detail.In my bedroom, the wifi coverage from my router is weak and patchy - as received by the built-in wireless on my laptop - so I thought I would try using this adapter instead.The adapter comes with a USB extension, which I think is very helpful for troublesome locations, as you can experiment with different placements and escape \"dead zones\".It also includes a small CD with complete drivers.  For any other device, the drivers could be on the web... but... if you bought this adapter because your internal wireless adapter is dead, then you can't download the drivers, because you need this device to get on the Internet !  So, it is good that TP-LINK has considered that possibility.  Of course, it's also simpler to just insert the CD.  The only flaw in this system is that some devices have no CD drive - then you will need to use another laptop or PC to either transfer the CD's contents to a USB flashdrive, or else download them from tp-link.us web site and transfer to a USB flashdrive.Anyway, the install was very easy, and all I had to do was click on my router's ID, enter my password, and it was up and running.The wireless G performance is excellent, and the USB extension allowed me to find a point in my bedroom to position the adapter, that always has good wireless coverage from my router, so everything is cool now for using my laptop in bed. :)So far, I've had good experiences with TP-LINK products.  If I change my mind, I'll come back and update the relevant reviews.  When I get an N router, I'll update with the N performance too. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How do you like the screen?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I was shopping around for a Windows based tablet for the past 6 months.  Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility.

      "Corresponding review: This movie has ruined cape-wearing for me. Who knew they were such health hazards?In this Pixar movie, a family of undercover superheroes are living quietly in suburbia but are forced into action to save the world.Bob Paar was once Mr. Incredible, one of the world's greatest superheroes, known for saving lives and fighting evil.  He and his wife, Elastigirl, have been ordered to give up their superhero careers and are living in a witness protection program as if they are just your average humans.  Then Bob is approached about a top-secret assignment and everything changes.This story is well written and the characters are more human than a lot of characters who are actually human.  They have emotions and big hearts and they love, make sacrifices, discover truths about each other and themselves, suffer, and feel loss.  They also argue about which is the right turn on the freeway and deal with unruly kids who have strong wills and their own minds about how things should work.  The animation and visuals are glorious and stunning, and the story itself is inspiring, unbeliebably creative, and downright extraordinary.  I especially love the scene where dash is running with a layer of Violet's force field all around him, so he's like a gerbil in a plastic ball!My entire family loved this movie when it was in the theatre and we had to have the DVD as soon as possible (which is rare in this penny-pinching household) so we could experience it all over again.  See it, and you'll be entertained, get charged up, be inspired, and laugh and laugh and laugh. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How was the book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Sometimes John Grisham gets it exactly right. The Racketeer joins the list ofA Time to Kill: A Novel,The Rainmaker, andThe Appealof lawyers' lawyer books that delight with every page.Meet Malcolm Bannister, age 43, African-American, and an inmate at a federal work camp in Frostburg Maryland. Five years ago, he was a lawyer in the town of Winchester Virginia, making somewhat of living along with two partners. Overzealous federal prosecutors indicted him for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, otherwise known as RICO, and when the dust had settled Bannister found himself on the wrong end of a ten year sentence. That Bannister's \"crimes\" were essentially illusory is beside the point. A jury, under the gun of the so-called \"shotgun charge\" read to deadlocked panels, convicted him and his appeals have run their course. Malcolm is gonna finish out his time, and then return to a world without his profession, wife and kid.There are only two things for an inmate with the skills of Bannister to do-practice a little jailhouse law and scheme to get out.The opportunity for the second comes with the murder of a United States District Judge in Roanoke. Killing a federal judge is a very serious offense. In fact only four sitting federal judges have been killed in our nation's history-all within the last thirty years. I actually appeared before one of those judges Robert Vance of the Eleventh Circuit. A classmate of mine from law school was appointed to represent his assassin and I followed his trial and conviction closely. So when I say as a trial lawyer in the federal courts for thirty seven years that this book is incredibly authentic, I have a substantial basis for that opinion. Lawyers reading this book will recognize the cast of characters from lawyers, inmates, U.S. Marshals, FBI agents, judges and corrections officers. It is absolutely spot on.It is also incredibly imaginative. Grisham always tells a good story, but this one is quite special. Pick it up today. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue. For any one who isn't a fan of Star Wars or enjoys solid movies with a plot feel free to pass on this popular yet boring movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Complementary coffee in the morning however, they have stopped with the biscotti!In addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation. So I figured times must be hard.As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment. That set me off since I did try to do that. So I had problems with the check in and check out staff .On the other hand, the valet parking attendant/bell people were very friendly.Do not know if I will stay there again, due to the problems with the staff at the check in/out counter.

The story and setting are captivating. The characters come alive with clever dialogue and vivid descriptions. The novel grips you to the very end and leaves you wanting more. Thankfully, there are several more books in the series, each just as good as the last, while at the same time each stands on its own two metaphorical feet, continuing the story without ever being repetitive. Thank you Diana Gabaldon.End-note: this novel is intended for Adult readers. There is mature content within. For example, do not take it as a gift to a 12 year old's birthday party, or allow anyone really under the age of eighteen or so to randomly flip open a page.

      "Corresponding review: I loved watching rom-com movies, so having found a book that fits that genre was a delight for me. Alexandria \"Alexa\" McKenzie made a wish to Earth Mother asking for a husband, one who is handsome, is a generous lover in bed, loves animals, and is a Mets fan. And did I mention he also had to have $150,000 available? Her family fell into a tough financial situation, so in order to save her family home, she is willing to enter a marriage of convenience in exchange for money to help her family.In enters Nicholas \"Nick\" Ryan, the brother of Alexa's best friend. Consequently, he is also in the market looking for marriage. When his Uncle Earl passed away, the terms of his will dictated that Nick must marry in order to gain control of Dreamscape, the family's architectural firm. Growing up in a environment where his parents used their children as pawns, he doesn't believe in happily-ever-afters. And potential marriage to Alexa, the girl who teased him throughout his childhood, didn't sit well with him.Having grown up together, they had a chemistry that most married couples get after decades of marriage. But years of falling out of contact with one another also brought clashes. Their banter and bickering is very amusing, displaying the differences in their personalities.The characters are very endearing and lovable. Jennifer Probst did a wonderful job of fleshing out her characters, making the reader love them as they fall in love with each other. And when complications arise that threaten their marriage, you find yourself hoping that they'll end up together in the end because Nick and Alexa complement each other so well.A wonderful story to read and judging by the end of the book, it seems like a sequel is coming. I cannot wait to read about the story of the Italian count and Maggie, which should be out on June 15. I'm counting down my days! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

They were attentive and friendly without being obtrusive or fake. I had the jesus juice cocktail, which was tasty and refreshing and had just the right amount of sweetness for a very hot summer day. We had a bunch of the tacos, and all were perfect. A big standout for me was their shrimp taco. The shrimp inside was breaded and fried, which made me nervous that it would only taste like batter and oil. I was so wrong. It had a wonderful shrimp flavor that was perfectly complemented by the sauce. The beef cheek was also a highlight. Although there are lots of places to get cheaper tacos in the city, I will definitely be back to Grand Electric. The patio, service, cocktails, and variety of delicious taco options make it absolutely worth it. Would recommend to anyone. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Ten to the T, to the IME. If your group of ten is craving Thai food and don't want to wait for hours on end to be seated (in comparison to many other popping Thai places in Toronto), this place is your gig. For food to arrive may take a while longer, but what's the rush when you have a large group and can chit chat your way till your stomach grumbles in protest? Pad Thai at Sukho Thai is what I buy, now will you try? Man, I missed my career calling as a rapper. Haha! I'm sure the music industry is thankful I missed that boat. At this restaurant, the curry isn't as thick and flavorful in comparison to other sites in town so I stick with pad Thai. Caution. Spicy is no joke. We aren't talking about Canadian Spicy. We're talking about Thai spicy that can keep you mouth hot bite after bite. Could add a dash of lime, but the noodles are very flavorful, well balanced with bean sprouts that add a slight crunch, topped with peanuts that add to the presentation and texture, mixed with well cooked chicken that is slightly on the dry side but I haven't had juicy chicken in pad Thai before, even in my days visiting Bangkok. The shrimp is seasoned and crispy, a dash of spice that adds an authentic flavor to the magic dish. Cashew chicken is also very tasty. Chicken is well cooked but juicy within. Then again, did you really expect a bad review for deep fried dishes? Who are we kidding... deep fried dishes are usually a win for many of us. Overall is a restaurant that I come back to here and there, but not a restaurant that I crave over. Mind you, took 1.5 hours before our food arrived.

I wasn't able to taste the cardamom that strongly, but still appreciated the flavor of this tea.I tested the tea to see if it would become bitter if the tea bag was left in, and even after 15 minutes it still did not pick up the nasty flavor that dark teas usually infuse after the tea bags are left in too long. Great for someone who is not looking to time their tea to the exact second when making it.A word of caution - they are not kidding when they say \"higher caffeine\" on the box. I would be careful drinking this near bedtime if you are sensitive to caffeine.Overall a great product from a great company. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This hotel has an excellent location in the Embarcadero area of San Francisco. Pier 39 is a short walk away, as is Ghiradelli Square. I booked the hotel thru Hotwire, where it is listed as a 4 Star hotel. As I watched a couple of people paying rack rate for their rooms (Approx $189) I was happy with the price we had received. Know I have no idea what makes a hotel a 4 star hotel, but I did like the place. It was clean, ''most'' of the staff was friendly (all of the housekeeping staff where nice) and it was in a great location. On arrival I had been put in a smoking room (even after asking 2 times not to be). When I told them I would need to be moved, they did so quickly. After moving to the non smoking room, I saw that the door handle on the outside of all the rooms in that wing, on that floor, had the no smoking signs etched on the panels. Free Wi-Fi. I have started taking my laptop on trips where I feel it is safe to do so. The hotel offers wi-fi access for a fee (did not check how much), but when I booted up my laptop, I saw that there were several free access points in range (how cool was that). I dont know if it was relevent, but I was in a room on the Mason St side of the hotel. Parking. If you drive to this hotel and want to park in the hotel parking be prepared to take out a 2nd on your home, or ready to hawk your second born child. The onsite hotel parking was in the $40/night range. But, my sister found a better solution. There is a shopping mall across the street to the south of the hotel. She said parking was more like $25 a night. I had read several less than favorable reviews about this hotel (after booking it), but they missed the mark as far as my stay was concerned. I would deff recommend this hotel to friends and family (if they can get the Hotwire rate) as the loction could not be beat. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: Though the film 's violence might you from seeing this film you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the scene?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The Passion of the Christ, the very controversial Mel Gibson religious epic has been highly anticipated and now released.  I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't \"like\" or \"dislike.\"  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \"R\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood.  There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.  Though the film's violence might derive you from seeing this film, you should definetly experience especially at the movie theatre.  You must see it to believe it, see The Passion of the Christ ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is another in the \"Midnite Movies\" releases from MGM(double sided disc) and in my oppinion the best film here out of the two is the 1959 production of Invisible Invaders,starring John Carradine.However this film has got to hold some kind of record for killing off it's name star within the first three minutes of the picture! For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr.Noymann in a radiation accident.After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr.Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world.He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him.Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence.Dr.Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead.The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die.Earth one,aliens nothing.Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie.Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is.It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster.Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.Journey puts the \"bad\" into the B-movie.It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn.Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location.The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them.They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested.Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet.They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way.Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship.A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave.Outside is waiting one of the captain's \"mirage\" women and for some reason he takes her aboard.All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the \"mirage\" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day \"Journey to the 7th Planet\"plays.Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration.John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however.Invaders is in B&W; (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format.Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp.Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate.Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind.I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!

      "Human answer: mysteriously embedded into a settlement ( The Glade ) populated by other boys his own age\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the mystery?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I first became aware of this series when I won an autographed copy of the first Infinity Ring book (WooHoo), which was written by James Dashner. Then, once I heard that The Maze Runner was to hit the big screen I was reminded that it was floundering somewhere in my to-read list. So, finally after much delay I brought it.When I first started reading it I was reminded of a book from my school days, Lord of the Flies. I was a tad concerned that it was going to be along the same lines because it was &#8217;required reading&#8217; at school rather than &#8217;my choice&#8217;, I wasn&#8217;t really keen on the thought (even though I can&#8217;t really remember the specifics of LOTF).But, I&#8217;m pleased to say that after the first few chapters I became captivated by the story and its characters. Thomas is our main guy, he&#8217;s sort of been mysteriously embedded into a settlement (The Glade) populated by other boys his own age. He has no memory of who he is or where he came, which he soon finds is common for all &#8217;greenies&#8217; that arrive in the Glade.The Glade is a sanctuary of sorts, which is at the centre of a huge maze that changes its shape every day. We follow Thomas as he works through the many struggles of adapting to his new life and learns about the ways of the Glade. He finds that every kid has a role, and every role is just as important as the next. Life in the Glade can be quite tough, but the Gladers have created a society that has rules and runs well.Every day, a team of Runners enter the maze to try to find a way back to the real world. But, the maze is full of hidden dangers and all runners must return to the Glade before the huge doors close at the end of each day. Anyone unlucky enough to be trapped in the maze overnight is in big trouble.Soon, the arrival of another mysterious &#8217;greenie&#8217; sets the wheels in motion for Thomas and the other Gladers to go for broke, and try and find the answers they all long for. Who are they? Where are they from? How do they escape? Who can they trust?There&#8217;ll be no more details on the plot from me. I&#8217;ll just say that this is an exciting book, so I suggest that you grab a copy and read it for yourself.My bottom line: This book has great mystery, action, and likable characters. I can honestly say that this is a series that I&#8217;m keen to keep reading. I&#8217;m looking forward to getting into the next book &#8230;. and the movie too.PS: I&#8217;d put this book and movie in the YA category rather than MG.Note: I don&#8217;t claim to be a pro-reviewer, I am a reader. My reviews are based on my personal thoughts around the story that the book is trying to tell. I try to focus on the story (which is the reason I read) rather than dissect the book and pass comment on typos, writing style or structure. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am reviewing the Creamy Red Pepper with Smoked Gouda soup.This soup was really good. I actually expected it to be a bit thicker, like a tomato soup, but this was like a slightly watered down tomato soup. There were generous amounts of chunks of tomatoes and red peppers throughout and spices visible throughout (parsley and basil?). The taste was great. Not too peppery, tomatoey, or cheesy, but just right.The instructions were simple and the bag was easy to tear at the indicated corner. 2-2.5 minutes, as indicated in the instructions, was perfect for the microwave I used at work so the soup came out hot, but not scalding hot where I had to wait to eat it. I just poured it right into a Tupperware container and it was perfect.I think this might be a more pricey route to go for soup at lunch than opening a can, but there's more soup in here than a small can as well. The flavors for these soups sound more interesting and appetizing than a typical can of soup. It's also nice that you can heat the pouch all together in the microwave then just pour into a bowl. However, you can't recycle these pouches (as far as I know) while you can recycle soup cans in most places...if that is something that is important to you.The Nutrition Facts are as follows: (apparently the serving size is 1C. but the pouch is 14 oz., so a pouch is almost 2 servings)Calories: 220Total Fat: 15gCholesterol: 60mgSodium 780mgTotal Carbs: 15gProtein: 6g ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the flavor of the coffee?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Original review:I love Gevalia coffees. I used to be a subscriber to their coffee service and would look forward to my monthly shipments. For the most part their coffee is simply stellar. This coffee smells delicious out of the package, and while brewing, but the chocolate taste is too much for my palate. Never thought I would say that something is too chocolatey but this is! If you are a choco-holic this might be the perfect coffee for you. It is a chocolate truffle so I guess it is to be expected.Update to this review:A couple of weeks later I returned to this coffee. But with one difference. I halved the amount of coffee I brewed with and voila! The flavors came right out in a very pleasant way. The mistake was definitely mine. I like my coffee strong yet I was defintely making this coffee too strong! I say, if you love chocolate and coffee you should give this a shot but make it with about half of what you use to make regular old coffee. The flavors just come right out in a balanced way. My original review was three stars, I have upgraded to four. Could be a 4.5. I would definitely buy this coffee again.I have written many reviews and have never updated one. I was so surprised by how good this coffee turned out that I felt impelled to re-write my review. My original title was: \"Smells great but way too chocolatey\" and it just doesn't apply once I got the right quantity. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

In fact, the cord did not reach the nearest outlet, so I tried picking up the coffee maker to move it closer. The cord was fixed to the back of the desk, making it impossible to move it. How stupid!

      "Corresponding question: How is the film?\n",
      "Corresponding review: With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.  And if you become a huge admirer and fan, then this 3-disc spectacular is going to be right down your alley.--D. Mikels, Esq. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Wow! How do you spell `Wow\" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of \"Batman Begins\".Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, \"The Last Emperor\"), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, \"28 Days Later\"), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton \"Batman\" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\", \"Insomnia\") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In \"Batman Begins\", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in \"Star Wars Episode III\". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And \"Begins\" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In \"Begins\", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood? They always have to rely on a sequel? \"Batman Begins\" was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise. And Nolan has done that. At the end of the film, there is a brief coda setting up the inevitable sequel. In this case, Nolan suggests that there is so much more to be done with the story, the characters, the villains, that I welcome a sequel.Bring on the sequels, Mr. Nolan. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

This is a new book and feel about things that we read alot about like dragons, souls, reincarnation and etc.. The author has done an amazing job with the unique world that she has created. I'm tickled pink to say that I stayed up all night read this book because I couldn't put it down and didn't want to stop. I wanted to figure out who was after Ana and Sam and also who was following them. I simply can't wait to read the next book in this series and I hope that it is better than the first, because I'm reeling about the ending....Okay if you haven't figured it out yet I LOVE LOVE LOVE this read! The author has done a great job on the characters with the descriptions, personalities, and love the dialogue. The unique world was so wonderful that I could just imagine myself right there with Ana while she struggles to become something better than a no soul. The romance of Ana and Same even made it the story even better with the tension filled talks between them and the hormonal issues that every young adult faces. This book is as unique as the cover and as beautiful and breathtaking as a butterfly.Amazon Book Description~New soulAna is new.

      "Corresponding question: How big are the hamburgers?\n",
      "Corresponding review: It has to be said that the arrival of Holy Chuck following on the heels of the success of Burger's Priest caused some people to say that the former was ripping off the latter. Having eaten at both I'd have to agree that the timing was decidedly convenient in its indication that that claim was true. Still, there are a few differences. Both have secret menus. Both have their own version of the Big Mac sandwich. Both have order counters and then seating areas for the hardcore. And both grind their beef fresh daily. But I'd give kudos to Burger's Priest for a few reasons: While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, they were the original. Secondly, they're the better of the two. Lastly, while neither is incredibly cheap, the imitator (Holy Chuck) is more expensive ($38 for two burgers, one fry and two sodas). Holy Chuck is a good, decent burger. I ordered their Big Mac and it was delicious. The fries were tasty. The soda was soda, although they do have those cool Pininfarina machines. But what put me off was that there was simply not enough effort here to justify a $38 price tag for two burgers and a side. This is still a take out counter just like McDonald's, and while the quality is obviously higher here when it comes down to it, its a hamburger and it tastes an awful lot like you're getting charged too much, especially when up the street at McD's it's still $10 for the Big Mac combo (and that's supersized).You won't be disappointed, but I wasn't overly impressed.

      "Corresponding review: .We purchased this set after returning the disappointing Vizio M3D470KD  3D TV.We love this set. Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, \"soap opera effect.\" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and \"live\" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

But when we arrived it was wonderful! The front desk was unbelievable professional and extremely friendly. Although we arrived a bit too early for check in, our luggage was stored while we toured the city. The Adagio is a 5-10 minute walk to Union Square and the start of the cable car line to Fisherman's Wharf. The room was small-ish but did not feel as if we were tripping over one another. If you are on the fence about staying here please reconsider. The Adagio will set you up with a FREE PRIVATE CITY TOUR!!!!! The hotel will also provide complimentary copies of suggested itineraries for San Francisco and a number of destinations in the area. We took a nighttime tour of Alcatraz and when we returned to the Adagio in the evening we discovered our hotel was right around the corner from a ton of night life. We did not find the noise a problem - we only wished we had the energy to enjoy the neighborhood clubs! Bottom line, STAY HERE. I can't wait to visit again! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: First off, we booked this hotel through Priceline. We got it from Sunday to Wednesday for $135 a night, which was a great deal and I think very good value. It's certainly worth the booking price via their own website but you can find a good deal out there for it too.The Tuscan Inn was a great place to stay. It's very close to Fisherman's Wharf, within walking distance to the Coit Tower and even Chinatown. The street cars are also only a block away. The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded. The beds and linens are quite nice too.The hotel staff are really friendly. We were very impressed with both of the concierges that were working and found them extremely useful. The people at the front desk were friendly save for one girl who we found consistently rude and abrasive. (ie, I brought a five dollar bill up to the front desk and before I could say anything she said &quot;we don't give change&quot; and walked away). With the exception of this one bad egg, everyone was very nice.The free wine/beer and coffee/hot chocolate/biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it. I would recommend making reservations at the restaurant as it quickly filled up every night and we were turned away frequently - I heard one traveller get into a heated discussion about never being able to get in for dinner.My only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not on the first floor, or a room with a view of the garden. The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am. It makes a lot of noise too - just a tip.Anyway, we loved it at this hotel and were very happy. Last word of caution - if you're going to San Francisco, don't rent a car. Parking is expensive ($40 per night) and everything is very much within walking distance. We took a cab across town and it was $10...Have fun! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How big is the unit?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I am *so* glad I traded a (refurbished) 8.9\" in for a (new) 7\"!! The refurbished unit was like new btw. But having grown accustomed to my previous 7\" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality \"video card\" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard \"fabric\" that completely zips around unit and has no \"straps\" (Marware beige)Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7\" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast.

      "Corresponding review: Right out of the wrapper, this bar doesn't exactly appear appetizing.  Taking a bite of it, though, I found it to be pretty good.  This is definitely not a good snack for anyone with nut allergies, as it's studded with nuts.  If you're not allergic, it may make for a nice snack, if you are not bothered by the following.First off, the primary flavor of this bar comes from the ground dates.  While I could taste the blueberry in it, it was more something that would sneak up on me every few bites or so.  Mostly, it tasted like I was eating a ground date bar.  The nuts provide a nice crunchy contrast but, like the blueberries, I only encountered them every couple of bites.  If you're a big fan of dates, you would likely really enjoy this bar.  If you don't like dates, this is definitely not for you.The thing that really held me back from truly liking the bar, though, was the texture of it.  I liked the crunch of the nuts, but the bar has a very grainy texture, which is also a result of its being mostly dates.  With each bite I took, I liked the flavor and really wanted to like the bar, but I just couldn't get past the texture.  I like the concept of it, but I think it would have tasted better if it had fewer dates and more grains, giving it more of a granola bar texture. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The cans are small and stylish, perfect for carrying in your purse or backpack. Kids like it, and the smaller size makes it a more sensible serving.The company is ecologically and socially responsible, too.What's more, this flavor is very nice with a touch of Cointreau for a sophisticated and festive cocktail.An excellent alternative to sodas.

      "Corresponding question: How is that texture?\n",
      "Corresponding review: NUTRITIONAL VALUE:Back to Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat Graham Crackers are 100% natural and naturally flavored (per the box). From a health standpoint, the ingredient list IS much more natural that most similar food products--everything on the list is pronouncable and understandable. The box claims that there are 19g or more per serving of whole grains in these crackers and lists the serving size as 8 crackers or 2 full cracker sheets. Following is per-serving nutritional information for those who care:Calories: 110Total Fat: 2.5gMonounsat: 1.5g (the other gram of fat is not accounted for that I could see)Sodium: 130mgPotassium: 85mgTotal Carbs: 22gDietary Fiber: 2gSugars: 8gProtein: 2gWhen compared with Nabisco Honey Maid Lowfat Cinnamon Grahams, these crackers have less calories, sugar and sodium than the Honey Maid Grahams. Honey Maid also uses HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and partially-hydrogenated oils which these do not. These crackers are sweetened using sugar, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate and raisin paste whereas Honey Maid uses honey, molasses, HFCS and dextrose.TASTE AND TEXTURE:TEXTURE: I found these crackers much more delicate than a standard graham cracker. There was a moderate to substantial amount of breakage from the shipping process. I found the dividing line for each cracker (within a sheet) much less discernable than a standard brand of graham crackers. I also found these crackers really dry--moreso than a regular brand. I'm assuming both of these things are because Back to Nature is trying to make a healthier cracker, but that's just my guess.TASTE: This is being sold as an Apple Cinnamon flavored graham cracker. For me, there was far too little graham flavor in these crackers and the cinnamon flavor was very lacking as well. The taste reminded me of a cross between bran muffins with raisins and bran muffins with dehydrated apples. There seemed to be some taste difference between the various sleeves of crackers.SUMMARY:If finding a healthier graham cracker is your primary concern, these may be your best bet. For me, flavor and texture concerns do not make the increased healthiness worth it for me. I have gotten some level of enjoyment out of trying them enough to write a fair review, but I would not buy them again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the bass?\n",
      "Corresponding review: These earbuds are nothing special. Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away. These will be a little bird's nest of tangled wires when you set them aside. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

In some ways the water and physics of water behave more &quot;lifelike&quot; than real water!!! Astounding, although anyone who is an avid PC gamer would have seen the extent of water effects in 3-D animation by now. Second, the voice acting. Some great performances, some instantly recognisable such as Albert Brooks or Geoffrey Rush. And the jokes are generally  not crass or rude, in some instances however only adults will &quot;get it&quot;!!! but it's always safe for the kids.The audio is great with a deep full bass and dynamic audio utilization through all ranges. The video quality is also great with sharp and distinct colours and contrasts. &quot;Reds&quot; look paritculary good. The one complaint I have is with the &quot;blues&quot; of Dory, Ellen DeGeneres. It seems that they are so bright that they are not defined as a result.She seems to be blending into whatever ocean environment she finds  herself.The characters that Marlin meets are for the most part interesting. My favourites are however the three sharks led by Bruce, a Great White with a wonderful Aussie accent, who is the leader of a self-help group promoting goodwill between fish and sharks. &quot;Remember, fish are friends, not food!&quot; the groups motto is recited at every meeting!!! I suppose i would have prefered it if they has spent more time with Bruce and his companions or possibly spent more time at the &quot;paaaahty&quot;.All in all, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a fun adventure, (2nd on my list after Monsters Inc), and should delight all children.

      "Corresponding review: In a remote part of Wisconsin, Gar Sawtelle, his wife Trudy and their young son, muteEdgar makes a living breeding and training dogs.  Edgar has developed a unique special relationship with Almondine, one of the family dogs; the pair communicates in a way that his parents are unable to do with their son.The family is contented although the work with the canines is hard.  When Gar's brother charming brother Claude comes home the family dynamics change but not in a positive manner.  Soon after his arrival Gar dies and the silent Edgar is unable to call for help.  He is filled with remorse and guilt making his grief even more difficult.  However, he soon believes his father was murdered by his uncle who has spent an exorbitant amount of time with his mom.  Fearing he may be next, Edgar flees accompanied by his best friends Almondine and two other dogs.Hamlet is brought into modern day Wisconsin as readers feel the destiny of tragedy will occur from the moment Claude arrives and after that happens, a sense of a second calamity once Edgar concludes his uncle killed his father to eliminate the sole barrier to his mother.  Readers will be spellbound by David Wrobleweski's retelling of the classic as the key cast comes alive especially the mute Edgar who readers get to know by his thoughts and his communication with Almondine (sort of in some ways like the Ghost).

Something with her style written for a more adult audience.The premise was interesting and there were allot of places it could go. (alien being in a human body, planet taken over etc.) I think my biggest criticism is that the main character seems like a revisit of her main character from Twilight- Bella. The caring, martyr that puts everyone above herself. The love story that develops takes a interesting turn, but makes itself a lot less complicated than the direction it seemed to be going. All in all it was enjoyable, just not as good as her other series. If you haven't read the Twilight series I recommend that more. Also I would not characterize this book as \"Adult\" there aren't any steamy love scenes or bouts of swearing like a sailor.Steph- if you happen to read this: I hope what I had to say (and others) doesn't discourage you.

Unlike competing peanut butter cups, there are no paper wrappers around the candy. The candy is simply formed in the shape of a cup.

I am in no way a coffee connoisseur, but with the K-Cups I am trying to find the perfect cup of joe.  This coffee was on the milder side and didn't have a strong flavor so drinking more than one cup of this was easy.  I only put creamer in my coffee and I think that may have diluted the taste.  It didn't have a bitter or strong aftertaste like some coffees/brands. The description noted floral/citrusy notes but I didn't taste it.

In fact, I was completely and entirely turned off by Sky's request, and even more by the fact that Holder actually goes along with it. It's completely against his character and just...dirty. I really, really hope it's not something the author hasn't personally experienced (as I wouldn't wish that on anyone), but I did find myself wondering, because it felt offensive to me. I didn't want to read more after that particular motel scene.Regardless, I did finish, and while the ending felt a bit rushed and oddly wrapped up, I do like the final bit with her mother and all the revelations there.

      "Corresponding review: This week I watched both this Swedish Blu-Ray and saw the just-released American remake in the theater, and I have read the first two books.I rate both versions at five stars--great films. There is 5.1 Dolby Digital in Swedish with the option of dubbed English dialog. I watched the Swedish language version with English subtitles, although the English dubbing did seem pretty good. The quality of sound and picture on the Blu-Ray is excellent.This Swedish film is closer to the book in detail and in dramatic portrayal. The scenery seemed more stark and cold, and the murders more appalling. Lizbeth's propensity for violence is better portrayed, and as the film progresses we get better insight into why Lizbeth is socially dysfunctional than in the American version. The reporter, Blomkvist, spends three months in jail in the Swedish version, but no jail time in the American version, and his humiliation is therefore all the greater.Noomi Repaces's Lizbeth is harsher than that of Rooney Mara in the American version and therefore more effective. Rooney Mara's amazing beauty inevitably softens her character in the American version even though her acting is excellent. The fate of the dead niece, Harriet, is far closer to the book in the Swedish version and has more dramatic impact.Noomi Repaces's dragon tattoo covers her back and is truly formidable. After all, the tattoo is the point of the title.There are many other gratuitous discrepancies in the American version that detract from the drama that made Larsson's book so powerful.Blomquist is portrayed as the same sharp researcher and unaware babe-magnet in both films. Michael Nyqvist and Daniel Craig both give excellent performances--true to Larsson's character--with Craig having the edge.If you are comfortable with subtitles, then this Swedish version might be your best choice, especially if you have already read the novel. If you prefer a more American style movie with well-known, somewhat better looking, Hollywood actors; especially if you have not read the book; then the American version may be your best choice. Or, as I did, watch the Swedish recording and then the American movie in the theater. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How did you like the router?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I am a professional writer, focusing on computer-related products, so I don't give 5 star reviews so easily. This product however definitely deserves it.The router took about 10' to install and has worked like a charm since then. Positioned in the ground floor of the house, it manages to give a strong enough signal to be received at 135 Mbps from the upper floor. And that's from my net-book, which has a quite mediocre network card. My room-mate claims that he has a super high speed, both for downloading and for uploading, from his desktop computer.The router has a fairly easy menu, though it took us a good 7 minutes to configure all the security settings (you can never be too careful these days). Other routers may be better in this aspect. However, this is something you only do once (or twice at most) so it's not a big deal.The bottom line is that this product is not just a good buy, but something you can cherish for a while. I would highly recommend it to any computer user who relies a lot on a wireless network for his/her internet access.One thing that it is a bit bizarre though is that the upload speed is about 3 times higher than the download speed, something that has been observed it two computers in our network. Usually DL speed is significantly lower than UL speed. That's not an issue though, since the important factor is the connection stability, which has exceeded our expectations. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing.

      "Corresponding question: How is the coffee?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

      "Corresponding review: These convenient, single-serve bags of popcorn go well in a lunch box or in a movie theater, and they're ready to grab and go. No popping and no waiting. They're priced at about 50 cents per bag, a lot cheaper than what cinemas charge for big containers that hold far more than most people want or need to eat.The taste is deliciously light and mild, without too much salt or cheese flavor. The pre-popped kernels are large and fluffy, but they're not crunchy, so if that's the texture you're looking for, you'll have to try another product. The coating is powdery, which I find preferable to an oily or greasy coating.I myself would have liked each serving to be a bit larger, but then I'm a big popcorn lover. I suppose I'll just have to take two bags along with me. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is write?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I have read a couple of Sandra Bricker's books and I have yet to be let down by any of them.  Her books are light and fun, but meaningful and charming.  Always the Baker Never the Bride fits in nicely with her other books and what I have come to expect from this author.  I would have to say that among Sandra's books that I have read, this one is my favorite so far.  I love the baking and wedding theme in this book.  It creates a warm and romantic atmosphere for this story.  And, of course, who could miss the humorous irony of the most talented wedding cake baker in Atlanta being diabetic and unable to enjoy her own baking.  I love that!This book takes place in Atlanta and that means lots and lots of Southern charm; another huge positive.  Jackson Drake's sisters stole the show and added a happy, Southern family feel to this book.  Emma is a strong career woman who knows what she wants and can hold her own in the face of conflict, but at the same time she is sweet and sensitive.  The characters in this story have a strong presence in the romantic backdrop of The Tanglewood Inn, which makes this a well-rounded and very enjoyable novel.I highly recommend Always the Baker Never the Bride.  It is a wonderful story that has left me feeling happy, not to mention looking forward to Sandra Bricker's next novel. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I am a raw vegan with a heavy load of health issues, including Celiac Disease and food allergies. I but rarely eat commercially prepared snack/nutritional bars because typically they don't meet my dietary requirements. I much prefer the nutritional bars I prepare myself but being chronically ill and disabled, I don't always feel well enough to go through the effort. But living in hurricane country on the Gulf coast of Florida, I do like to have some kind of food bar on hand in my hurricane pantry along with my other emergency supplies.I was excited to findPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and have not been disappointed in the least. First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the \"closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.\"  Really!  A brownie doesn't get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I've experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I'm happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season! Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program is THE way to go too!  I am also signed up forPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)andPure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)which are also wonderful.

I would consider this just a little on the dark side milk chocolate, there is just a hint of the dark bitterness.  The taste is great and melts very smoothly in your mouth.The only reason I took off half a star was because the bar itself was hard and broken in many pieces.  I think the reason for this might be that the inner foil wrapper is loosely wrapped around the chocolate and can't help wonder if the chocolate dried out a little.

      "Corresponding review: Aladdin is true, classic, Disney magic. It has everything I've always wanted from my animated movies: gorgeous visuals, laugh-aloud humour, sing-along songs, an appealing hero, and a heroine little girls can feel good about looking up to. I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. \"One Jump Ahead\", \"Friend Like Me\", and \"Prince Ali\" delight and amuse, while the \"One Jump Ahead\" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping \"A Whole New World\" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Okay, okay, so I tend to be one of those people who doesn't read the hot, bestselling \"must-read\" books until everyone else on the planet has, but sometimes there's a good reason for that--and this book is a prime example of that. After finishing this book, I can only shake my head in amazement at its popularity.There's no reason to get into a \"loved it/hated it\" war with fans of the book. Instead, I'd like to give an honest blow-by-blow description for those who haven't read the book yet but are considering it. The book begins with about 100 pages devoted to intrigue in the world of Swedish financial publications...zzz...huh? What? Oh, I'm sorry. I fell asleep just typing that sentence, so imagine how bored I was while slogging through those dreary chapters. The book does begin to get interesting afterward, when an old man hires our intrepid main character to investigate the disappearance of his beloved relative, who vanished from an island years before in a sort of a \"locked room\" type mystery.During the investigation, our intrepid main character comes across a series of old murders that could be linked to the disappearance of the old man's relative. Was she the victim of a serial killer? Did she vanish because she knew too much? These plot twists make the book much more exciting--for a while. Unfortunately, though, the mystery behind the disappearance of the girl is laughably un-mysterious, and the story of the serial killer is trite, worn-out, and needed far more explanation in order to be really interesting. For instance--and I don't feel a spoiler alert is necessary here--the killer performs some strange rituals during the killings, but the reasons behind these are never explained. Once the killer is revealed, the only explanation seems to be that the killer was a nut job who did crazy things.So, in conclusion--tired plot, poorly-executed mystery, too many boring chapters about Swedish financial publications, and about 300 pages too many in general (I'm starting to think there's a dire shortage of editors in Sweden). My advice? Read at your own risk--but keep plenty of strong coffee at hand. You'll need it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: My husband and I stayed at the Cow Hollow Inn September 20 - 25. We booked it based on TripAdvisor reviews. I'm very glad I found this hotel here because the only way to book is directly through the hotel (no Orbitz, hotels.com, etc). The hotel is very easy to get to and is in a great neighborhood. I was a little worried that there might not be much around the hotel since it's not near Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf, but there's actually quite a few little shops and at least 30 restaurants within a 2 block radius of the hotel. The first night we were there, we walked to the bay - it was a quick 1/4-1/2 mile walk - which was a great way to look at all the million-dollar houses in the area (what beautiful architecture!) It's an upscale neighborhood and I always felt safe outside.There are several bus stops within 2-3 blocks. We used the bus system the entire time we were there - it's definitely the easiest way to get around. We did get a rental car, but only used it to get to/from the airport and for a trip to Muir Woods one day. The hotel does have free parking.Our room was cleaned very well every day. We didn't have any interaction with hotel staff other than check-in and check-out. I recommend bringing a key chain because all they give you is a loose key.We did not have any problem with noise, however my husband often falls asleep with the TV on, so the two of us are probably just used to some noise. Our room was on the first floor facing Steiner street (I've attached a photo taken from our window, facing the corner of Steiner and Lombard).Things that didn't add or take away from our stay, but I would recommend to the hotel management:- The pictures on the website seriously need to be updated. The ugly wallpaper in those pictures is no longer in the rooms. Our room was much more pleasant looking in person than in the website pictures.- It would've been nice to have a comfy chair or small couch in the corner of our room. The bay window is lovely, but there's just this big empty space next to it. Our room had a single king bed, so the double bed rooms probably fill this space better.- I wouldn't book my stay on the website because it does not have a secure server (http vs. https).- When I went to check out at 5:30am, no one was at the front desk. After a few minutes, I thought I heard someone rustling in back, so I called out &quot;Hello??&quot; That did the trick. :o) I think if employees are going to hang out in back during slow times, a bell on the door or on the desk would be an easy solution.We ate at many of the restaurants close to our hotel and enjoyed them all:- Country Sky Chinese (across Steiner street) - We loved this place! Our food was fantastic and the staff was incredibly sweet.- Barney's Gourmet Hamburgers (next door on Steiner) - Food was good, but the wait was long (and the restaurant wasn't full). I'd still recommend this place - it seems as though the entire town is short on wait staff, and everyone works very hard.- Izzy's Steak and Chops (across Steiner street) - This was a treat. I had Swordfish and just loved it, my husband had lamb and said it was good, but not the best he'd had. This was the most expensive place we visited.- Mel's Diner (across Lombard street) - This is a 50's style, jukebox diner. Food was good, milkshakes were great. We enjoyed our meal, but it didn't really make me think of &quot;San Francisco&quot;.- Squat and Gobble (on Chestnut, about a 2 block walk from the hotel) - We had lunch here and it was fantastic. Lots of salads and crepes.- Korean BBQ (I can't remember the actual name of the restaurant, but it's right next to the hotel on Steiner street) - We got take-out one night and ate it in our hotel room. My husband really enjoyed this, but it was the first time either of us had eaten Korean food, so I can't tell you how authentic it was. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: First, I have to say that when I got this product, my kids were quite excited.  They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say \"simmer & stir often\", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word \"broccoli\" out of it.

      "Corresponding review: Just like different brands of regular bottled waters have their own taste to them, so does this avitae. It reminds me of the most un-softened water you can think of. It tastes a lot like the water we get straight from the tap here in Northern Minnesota (we have really good water). I don't drink coffee at all, next to no soda at all and basically just drink black tea and water. So any caffeine I get usually has to be in the form of a hot cup of tea, not always the best beverage for warm summer days. With this avitae, I can have a cold bottled water on hot days and still get an energy lift from caffeine. Also if you decide you want to liven up the water a little, you can add a few drops of drink mix to it to turn it into whatever kind of drink you want. Mixes likeMIO Strawberry Watermelon,Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade PacketsandVitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punchwould be perfect to have on hand in case you're out and want to give your caffeinated water a boost of flavor.

      "Corresponding review: We made the mistake of trying this place during a peak time-  Saturday night at 7pm. We were walking down Adelaide looking for the place, when my husband saw an unmarked storefront with a lineup outside. I wonder what's going on there? he wondered out loud. Then we realized it was the restaurant. We were given a wait time of 1.5 hours, so we headed to a pub to kill some time. We came back at 8:30 and we were seated right away. We ordered the squash fritters, the Khao Soi, and the Chef's Pad Thai. Here are my reviews:Squash Fritters: They were not what I expected but they were delicious just the same. They are unlike anything I'd ever tasted, and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it really elevated things to the next level. You MUST get them at least once.Chef's Pad Thai: The most complex pad thai ever! It was extremely flavorful and yet perfectly balanced. The chicken was delicious and there were no weird pieces- which is very important to me : )Khao Soi: It's no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. We ordered it with beef at the recommendation of our server and were not disappointed. The beef was obviously slow cooked, and was so tender that it fell apart on our forks. The rich curry sauce was like heaven.I would definitely recommend ordering multiple items and sharing. Each dish is so flavorful and rich that it's nice to be able to have some variety. Our bill for the above dishes plus 2 drinks was about $50. Not bad, considering we took enough food home to have it again for dinner the next night. While we're glad we waited, we would try to go at a non-peak hour on our next visit.Maybe it's because we were starving by the time we sat down, but my husband and I agree that this is the best thai food we've ever had. So unique, and yet traditional  at the same time.If you don't give Khao San Road a try, you're really missing out. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The aroma is very pleasant, sweet and floral. The taste, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The aroma is promising you the moon and your brain is going \"Yes, yes, yes!\" and then the taste doesn't have the goods, you know? Kind of thin-tasting. I've had a locally-produced hibiscus tea which has a more assertive flavor (if not the incredible color). I'm going to let this cool down and make some iced tea later and see if that doesn't help this tea out a bit. Another sip. The aroma is heavenly. But the taste is absent.This comes not in a teabag, but a clever little synthetic-material pyramid for some reason. Very novel. Novelty is valuable. Really just the fact that this stuff is so different and comes in a little pyramid tea infuser would make it a nice stocking-stuffer type gift for the tea lover(s) in your life. Or \"teabags\" as a British ex-roommate once described dedicated tea drinkers. Another sip. Still kind of weak-tasting, but I wonder if you couldn't put this stuff in a room humidifier... (don't try this, it's just a thought because this tea smells so great)...The flavor is growing on me, but it's still thin-tasting compared to the incredible aroma...---Unfortunately, this tea wasn't very good as iced tea.

      "Corresponding review: This is one of the most hyped books of last couple of years and this reviewer cannot see why.  The story has a cast of too many just for the sake of confusion.  The plot is plodding, the prose is poor and from a standpoint of a mystery, only the confusion of the many characters can mask the whodunit.The main characters are cold, quirky and barely likeable.  There are many times when things just happen to go our \"heroes\" way.  Without giving anything away, it is inconceivable that one person could do all of the high tech damage being done without any training at all.  And not only was this person perfect with a keyboard, but was simply able to outwit an entire corporation and the banking system in Switzerland.The plot was hung up on religious fervor and then, suddenly, it wasn't.  The finale was satisfying but hardly described.  The financial attack was basically an overview without any detail at all.  This is from an author that needed nearly fifty family members to smoke screen the mystery earlier in the story.  I guess the editors woke up and decided that enough was enough.Other Scandinavian authors have written better novels that bring the atmosphere of that region to the reader.  The locale of this novel could have been anywhere for as much as the author used it.I am rounding it up to three stars for an adequate plot and at least a satisfying ending. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is this movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This film is a blood fest delivered as a sly wink with Tarantino's tongue planted firmly in his cheek. He pays tribute to many films in this movie, particularly Honk Kong martial art films of the seventies. Like good rock and roll, the film explodes into action from the beginning and really doesn't let up until the last scene.One can see that he and the cast had a good time making this film, and the fight scenes are hilarious and way over the top. Revenge is the film's theme taken to extremes and Uma Thurman does a fine job seeming to capture exactly what Tarantino had in mind.There were moments in watching the film that I wanted to take it seriously, but as the blood gushed forth endlessly, this was difficult to do. Tarantino appears to have a compulsion about seventies kitsch; somehow intending to make the tasteless and outlandish move beyond hip. The movie is tasteless, ultra-violent, but violent in a comic book context. I suppose this is why the violence lost its impact, because it's meant to be fantasy, dreams of a pubescent boy.There is no depth to this film in terms of narrative because it is really all about imitation and form. This film is not about the story, but a rendering of style, delivery and surfaces that sparkle. It is advertising copy stretched into a feature film. And as all good advertising does, it will grab our attention, dazzle our base emotions, manipulating our sensibilities, turning us into impulsive shoppers.This film is very clever, but that's exactly the point. This is about the wonder boy, Tarantino, reinforcing his image as wonder boy filmmaker, proving again how clever he really is. It is cleverness for its own sake. However, if one goes beyond the tired pastiche, ad copy rendering, and seventies music, Kill Bill is a cheap thrill though good fun while you're watching it, but is easily forgotten as the last credit rolls.

      "Corresponding review: In \"Lone Survivor\" author Marcus Luttrell (with Patrick Robinson) relates in 390 pages the heroic stand at \"Murphy's Ridge\", near the hamlet of Sabray, Afghanistan in 2005. Out-gunned at approximately 30-1, Luttrell's SEAL team, commanded by Michael Murphy, battled Taliban and al Qaeda terrorist fighters to a standstill 4 times until all of the SEAL team members were dead except Luttrell. Badly wounded, his escape and evasion tactics to avoid capture or death were clear thinking and noteworthy.Mechanically, the narrative was a disaster. Clich&eacute;-ridden and clumsy, the early chapters relate Luttrell's childhood in East Texas and his SEAL training which civilians might find interesting, but veterans can skip on through it. As the reader approaches mid-way, Mr. Luttrell opines on several issues including the Left leaning Main Stream Media, the ridiculous Rules of Engagement for our fighters in the region and other geopolitical issues for which he is grossly under qualified. The fact that he is correct is not the subject at hand.Continuing, Luttrell related the incredible bravery of team leader Michael Murphy as he purposely exposed himself to get cell phone reception to call for assistance. A support and extraction team was swiftly sent to the area but the chopper was hit by rockets with the loss of all hands.Befriended by local Afghans, Luttrell  was finally rescued by Green Beret and Ranger search teams.For his uncommon valor, Murphy was posthumously awarded the War On Terror's first Metal of Honor. Three others, including Luttrell, received the Navy Cross, the nation's second highest combat award for Navy and Marine Corps personnel.Mechanics aside, this story and this book are important. It is unlikely the heroic sacrifices of these war-fighters would have ever been fully told without it. I'd rate it 4 and 1/2 stars and well worth the readers's time. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Why is the movie soo confusing?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Inception is an interesting movie but might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a man who specializes in dream extractions (think corporate espionage) - going into a shared dream state using a military derived technique with a team and a subject to extract a piece of information from that subject's subconscious mind.  This can sometimes involve going into a dream within a dream (or more).Much was made of the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex but for a generation growing up watching Matrix movies (especially the latter two) this is positively straight forward - and that's not a bad thing.  This is helped by Cobb's new dream architect (played by Ellen Page) who is also new to this world and to whom he explains the rules of the dream world (and thereby us - something not as well done in the Matrix flicks).  In addition to these dream rules there are the complexities of Cobb himself and the guilt he feels over the tragedy of his wife and kids and how this affects his missions.  And the complexities of the new job - to plant an idea into the mind (this process is called inception) of a young business tycoon who has a strained relationship with his dying father.  So yes it is complex but at no time did I feel lost either and this is a major plus for the movie.Some other plusses are extremely cool effects in the dream worlds, likable and believable characters whose interactions are fun to watch, effective action scenes, light comedic moments that pop up rarely but never fall flat and a satisfying emotional arc for our main character.  Truly there are many positive aspects to this movie.Some minuses are that it's a bit too long with a few dragging dialog sequences that could probably have been edited down.  This leads to the fact that it does slow down in parts such that you begin to get antsy (not that I have a short attention span but in a world where anything can happen?).  Despite the preceding two sentences I have to admit that all the dialog added to the movie in one way or another.I was a bit distracted by the fact that the dream rules - although meticulously laid out (which is appreciated) - did not always feel like the movie followed to the letter as laid forth.  (possible minor spoilers) For example the rules of time of a dream within a dream, etc. are laid forth but at times things seem to happen way too fast a layer or two in compared with what we know the rules are.  I also understand that the filmmakers wanted a realistic representation but I felt that dreams were - on the whole - rather boring.  I get that these particular dreams were tailor made but they were so orderly it was a bit disconcerting.  No chaos, no random events, unless provoked by the outside world (or only the next layer up),  just cities and buildings and people in suits.  Speaking for myself (but I'm insane) my dreams are a bit more chaotic.  Then again there were a few surprises in there and a few very cool dream fight sequences.Overall, yes, I do recommend this movie.  It's not as complicated as you may initially think but carries its own for sure.  The characters are well developed and the action carried out quite well within a well defined universe.  It is long and you may struggle with some of the rules but overall the movie is rewarding in visuals, story, overall action and emotional depts.  A solid four stars. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Fiction writers often add details in the stories that don't sound believable. I know it's fiction, but I'm quickly turned off when a novel sites events that don't sound plausible. \"The Help\" is the rare novel that offers everything a reader could want in a good book. It's a true page-turner. One would never guess that this is Kathryn Stockett's debut novel. Her writing style is captivating. I generally don't enjoy books that have multiple narrators, but Stockett created such dynamic characters, she was able to pull it off beautifully. I would (and have) recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a Southern tale. I'm looking forward to reading more from Stockett in the future. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

As a human being, I just couldn't get enough of this story.  It's beautiful and tragic and raw and compelling and just plain phenomenal!  Despite a few mechanical and other minor flaws, it's a great book!  If you like a book that's wonderfully revolutionary, darkly provocative, and emotionally epic, this is for you.  I got teary-eyed several times throughout the novel, but the truth is that I was reading too fast, desperate to see what happened next, to let myself feel the emotion of it all.  With all that energy pent up, I read the quiet, understated afterword at the end.  And cried.  I totally want to read the entire trilogy again.  Don't let all the negative reviews out there get you down.  If you liked the first two books, you'll love the third.  It's an awesome, climatic, mind-blowing end to a story that's shattering on so many levels.  Let yourself get lost in it! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How fun  is the story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: There have been a lot of half-crazed movie characters in film history, you know the one; the kind of vaguely insane person that the movie truly revolves around, with the other characters only there to provide stark contrast with their recognizably sane posture.  They're also there to wonder aloud to themselves and each other, &quot;What's the matter with him?&quot;  To which someone usually responds, &quot;I don't know, but there's something about him that I like.&quot;  The thing about those movies (a lot of them came out of the 80's and early 90's, I know because in school we all imitated them), was the the core of those movies was the zany character exploration, and that was just about it.  See what kind of situations we can cook up and then throw this crazed, witty personae in there and see what happens.What's different about Pirates of the Caribbean, and Jack Sparrow in particular, is that the world he inhabits gave birth to him.  In the crazed personae movie--the nut-job seems to come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, which is half the fun but also half the shortcoming.  In Pirates of the Carribean, we expect Jack Sparrow to come sailing out of the horizon and to suddenly arrive in that world, and what a world!I think what lends Sparrow such credibility is his mixture of characterization.  Yes, he's wild and I suppose &quot;free,&quot; but there are moments where he gets serious (saluting the dead pirates), moments when he has to act and can pull through (like jumping in to save Elizabeth), moments where he has to educate (telling Will Turner the truth about his father).  When this happens, we give the character Sparrow something we don't give the hollow, crazed personae; respect.  Give Johnny Depp all the credit for being able to switch between these modes as well; being serious and respectable while maintaining the aura of Jack Sparrow; that he'll stick his tongue out at us and run off with the gold at any moment, but not without his effects.The world of &quot;Black Pearl&quot; is lush and surprising.  I didn't expect to believe the world of pirates, where all the exsists is ocean and the few ports that you can sail to.  Come to think of it, we only really see three locales during the whole movie, and the rest of it is on water.  How'd they pull that off?  My favorite scene is in the pirate pub where the bar-fight is perpetual; Jack Sparrow and his cohort (can't remember his name) sit and talk about ports, treasures, old pirates, schemes, boats, etc. all in the warm glow of candles and wood as they chug ale.  A pirate's life for me!Geoffery Rush, brilliant as ever.  When he says, &quot;Too long have I been without the taste of food or the comfort of a woman&quot; I believe him.  The man is a pirate outright, but in his eyes you can see the years of torment on a man from the curse piling up on him slowly.  Notice too how he rolls his eyes perfectly when he's at the moment of breaking the curse, and somehow Jack Sparrow convinces him not to.  How?  Maybe &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is really how Jack Sparrow has dogged Barbossa his whole career.The supporting cast is good, even Orlando Bloom who is still in Legolas mode.  Even though he played up Will Turner nicely as a bright-eyed, talented, somewhat intense young man (who has serious anxieties about his lineage, but why not?  It would bar him from his chances of Elizabeth), I did keep expecting him to jump up and go, &quot;He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn!&quot;  He does have a great moment where he jumps onto a ship with Sparrow and goes, &quot;Aye, avast!&quot; to which he's promptly laughed at.

Im sure spending $400+ on a flash has some benefits, but for the price you cant beat this flash. The pull out diffuser works well too.

      "Corresponding review: I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.

      "Corresponding question: Is the story in a book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Living in a dangerous world controlled by a weak, desperate queen, Charlie is harboring a dangerous secret. In her world, classes are drawn and enforced by the language you speak, and it is a crime punishable by death to know a language other than your own. Charlie doesn't just know another class's language--she knows them all. It's a difficult ability to hide, and her life depends on appearing ignorant. But one night, at an underground club, Charlie meets an intriguing young man, Max, who seems different from everyone else. This is quickly proven when she catches him speaking a language she's never heard before. Their encounter isn't by chance, and soon Charlie's world will be turned upside down.The Pledge is a dark and magical book with a very unique concept. Derting's world, which is a blend of dystopia and fantasy, is dangerous and full of hidden tunnels and carefully kept secrets that Charlie is slowly exposed to soon after meeting Max. Her family has sacrificed a great deal to keep her secret safe throughout her life, so she's always cautious, but she soon gets sucked into a conflict much bigger than herself. There are more than a few shocking surprises along the way--people who aren't at all what they appear, long-kept family secrets, and other secret abilities--that keep this book suspenseful and intriguing, and the threat of a queen who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is chilling. The book ends with a satisfying, open ending that will leaves room for a sequel in which hopefully many unanswered questions and unresolved issues will be addressed. The Pledge is an interesting departure from Derting's other work, but it is unique and promising.Cover Comments: I absolutely love this cover! How the girl's face is partially obscured, how the title is displayed, the darkness of it--it's so intriguing and mysterious! I think that this is one that a LOT of people will be drawn to!

The video has been flawless, never a single stutter.  Getting pictures and other files on my devices has been flawless as well.I just used it in a desert racing environment and it held up superbly. I was able to download video we were recording in the field and photos also taken in the field, to it and then wirelessly stream the footage/files to the required mobile devices in the field.  Being able to stream to multiple devices without wires is a godsend.  Multiple people could watch the footage as needed, edits could be made and uploaded quickly.  Thanks to this little gem much of the work was done in the field. Unlike others I got over 10 hours usage on a single charge.The unit held up to the dusty environment without issue.I will agree with other reviewers that the included documentation was sparse, but a quick trip to Seagate's site remedied that.The device was very easy and very fast to setup.  The apps for the mobile devices downloaded quickly and installed without issue on the iOS and Android devices. I had a password protected wireless network in under 5 minutes...that is hard to beat!0PC operation via USB 3.0 was fast and easy, as expected.I don't have a single complaint about this device.

      "Human answer: director 's cut its vast superiority to the shortened\n",
      "Corresponding question: Is the direction of the movie fantastic ?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Though Peter Jackson had always claimed that the 208 minute (roughly equal to \"Seven Samurai\" in length) DVD version of \"Lord of the Rings'\" first installment was not a director's cut, its vast superiority to the shortened theatrical release becomes clear immediately.For those initally dissapointed with \"Fellowship's\" overly fast pace (skipping over characterizations and details for the sake of action) , the seamlessly integrated 30 minutes of footage works wonders.Here are some Improvements:1) Instead of a mere adventure movie (or a cgi cartoon, some may argue), Jackson's FOTR now feels closer to the spirit of Tolkien's world. Through more maps, longer stays at various crucial locations, more journey time, more geographic and historical references, one finaly begins to get a sense of original work's epic scope. In fact, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is copied almost verbatim, and that's always a welcomed addition.2) Every character (even Gollum) gets at least some additonal exposure and all are considerably fleshed out. Aragorn benefits the most, now seeming more like a full-fledged human being (within epic conventions, though), rather than a straight-forward action hero. Galadriel, called a \"radioactive psycho\" by some, has other scenes here showing her true regal nature. Merry, Pippin, and especially Gimli, are more than buffoons to liven up the proceedings. Ian Holm's Bilbo, who was one of my favorite character portrayals in the film, also gets more screen time in the beginning, just like Tolkien wrote.3) The overall themes of the book are now much more apparent - the ring's temptation, the weakness of humans, the appeal of a simple lifestyle over industrialization, and the dissappearance of civilizations (elves). The Passing of the Elves scene, is quite amazing - a shame to have been cut in the first place, as it is fairly short.4) Some of the choppier and confusing parts of the theatrical version are elaborated upon and some questions are answered, such as \"How did the Ring betray Isildur ?\", or \"Why is Boromir so preoccupied with the Ring?\" Although Sam is not explicitly introduced as Frodo's servant, he is at least shown gardening at Bag End.Many complaints that I, and other fans of the book, had with the theatrical version are now fully resolved, and by all standards, as a whole this is a much better film, already approaching that sought-after but seldom-attained classic status in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Approaching, but still stopping short of perfection, because many of the fundamental issues persist.Here are my remaining Problems with FOTR in order of annoyance:1) Gratuitous use (or abuse, rather) of slow motion - esp. in the \"Noooooooooo\" scene right after Gandalf's fall in Moria, and the \"drowning\" of Sam scene. Cheesy and detracting.2) Overbearing, generic, omni-present score. Some scenes, like Boromir's attempt to take the ring, and his death, while well-acted, should have been fine without the bathetic, cringe-worthy accompaniment. Sometimes, silence can be just as effective in generating the proper emotions. Granted, the music is not all terrible, it's just excessive - but the cliched chanting has got to go.3) While I can forgive Merry and Pippin's all-too-fast integration into the Fellowship, The Council of Elrond scene, even with the additions (which help) still doesn't quite work. Oh well, at least we get to hear the actual \"ash nazg durbatuluk\" speach by Gandalf. And, there's a funny hidden parody of the scene on one of the DVDs.4) Saruman is still the cartoonish villain, with no extra depth.The Extra materials on the DVD are top-notch, and as you may have heard, go into minute detail regarding all the aspects of production. They will take hours of viewing, if you care enough to investigate. Some of the audio commentaries are interesting as well - it looks like the presence of Philippa Boyens who was a harder Tolkienite than the action-oriented Jackson, helped steer certain scenes into the right direction. And without Richard Taylor, Alan Lee and John Howe, the visuals (best thing about the film in the first place) would not have been possible. We also get some discussion about New Zealand (interactive map provided) and the filming locations.In summary : if you even remotely liked the film you saw a year ago, were hoping for an improvement, and did not make the mistake of purchasing the theatrical DVD in August - by all means get this one!

      "Corresponding question: How is the caramel?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates were delicious. If you like Werther's Caramel, you will like the chocolates. Although the caramel is not overpowering, when you first bite into the oval shaped wafer of chocolate is when you get an initial burst of the signature \"Werther's\" caramel taste, then the flavors meld together and the chocolate sets in and the caramel becomes an undertone to the chocolate. The chocolate is smooth and silky, however I would not call it extremely rich like a dark or bittersweet. They claim it is made in the \"Fine European Tradition\" and although it does not taste like a fine Swiss milk chocolate it is not a typical Hershey's or Nestle's taste either - I would say if Ghiradelli marbled their caramel into the chocolate itself rather than put it in the center that is the closest taste you would get to the Werther's Caramel Chocolates. One last thing  - when you unwrap the gold foil, the chocolates are \"pretty\" - the caramel is swirled in with the chocolate to create almost a \"zebra - like\" pattern, though that does not appear to be carried through the entire piece when you bite through it. Overall, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates were very satisfying, and you don't need to eat the whole bag to feel satiated. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: Was the story magical?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The novel is a wild, trippy ride through the inscapes of the mind meshed with the story of one woman's struggle to relate to her loved ones and the world around her.Joe Hill writes a good story. I loved the idea of inscapes, and especially the call out to Mid-World from the Dark Tower Series. The overarching story of how Vic McQueen deals with her gift (or curse) and her conflict with the antagonist, Charlie Manx, drive the story.My main criticism is that at times I felt that the narrative could have been tighter, and in fact a review I read on Amazon nailed how I feel:'NOS4A2 is epic in length, but not in scope.'Vic McQueen is the best part of the story. She has a gift or a curse, depending on your point of view, and her life unfolds in response to this gift (or curse). Joe Hill nails the reality of mental illness with his portrayal of the evolution of Vic's character. I felt a great deal of sympathy for her and pulled for her throughout the novel. Vic is the classic tragic heroine.Charlie Manx is a real-life villain. What he does is horrible, but when seen from his point of view you can understand why he does what he does. You understand why he thinks what he does is right. In that way Charlie is not a caricature, but I never sympathized. There are points in Charlie's history where Joe Hill could have tweaked a few events and made Charlie a villain for whom you feel sympathy, thus making Charlie deeper, but that never materialized.Outside of Vic, the real delight is the idea of inscapes--how everyone has their own perception of reality and that each of our perceptions of reality are linked. These perceptions of reality can become separate worlds whose extent are limited only by our imagination. It's a powerful set of ideas that Joe has put out there.Unlike Horns, Joe Hill's previous novel, I was able to set aside NOS4A2 when I needed to sleep--except for the climax. The last hundred or so pages flew by.In the end what makes NOS4A2 a good novel is the sum of the positives. Like I said, the prose could be tighter, but the lead character, Vic McQueen, and the story itself pull this novel together and make it a good read.If you like Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere or The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King, I think you might like NOS4A2.I will say that after reading NOS4A2 I now want a Rolls Royce Wraith.

I was wrong about that.Within afew minutes I was totally into it. The opening scene on the plane shows straight away that this guy is not normal. He is the only one not panicing and grabbing the oxygen masks because the plane looks to be about to crash.From then on its a few days in the life of Largeman (JD from Scrubs). Good and bad things happen to Largeman but he's not really bothered one way or another. The good include meeting up with old friends and meeting Natalie Portman. The bad include his mum dying, and a dog humping his leg (or maybe that was a good thing). It's one of those films that will either bore you to death, or you will enjoy every moment. It might annoy you, it might not. Best to just watch it with an open mind. There are plenty of comedy moments as well as sad ones. The soundtrack is excellent (if you like Chillout music like Zero 7) and there are plenty of slow motion effects (to music). These are balanced out pretty well and not over-done or too cheesy. There are plenty of weird characters for JD to meet along the way such as the nerdiest Knight of the round table ever, the stupidest cop ever, the least successful pet owners ever, the worst funeral singer ever, the friendliest guide dog ever, the doctor with the most certificates ever, and many more.All in all Garden State is a nice chillout film that is like eating a bowl of Ready Brek.

The chance she takes pays off and she wins the heart of a handsome professor (John Corbett of \"Northern Exposure and recently \"Sex in the City) that leads to a wedding proposal.  A good majority of the film follows the couple as she introduces him to the her huge Greek clan and he to his rather sedated parents.  Lanie Kazan and Michael Constantine are superb as her parents and Andrea Martin, as Aunt Voula, is a riot.  The chemistry between Vardalos and Corbett is real and very touching.

I've tried on numerous occasions to put a dent in Jordan's first book but usually I fall asleep or my mind wanders. Give me King, Gaiman, De Lint, Tolkien, Keyes, Fforde, and Salvatore... any of these guys and I'm a happy man. But I try to stay away from straight D&D; fantasy. \"He's not like that,\" they told me.Then, A Game of Thrones came in to our bookstore with a special price of $3.99. So I bought it. I'm a sucker for a good deal!Now, a few weeks later, I've finished it. And HOLY CRAP! That was GOOD! It was better than good it was GREAT! The characters are rich and fantastic and devious and wonderful and heart-breaking and maddening. This is character-driven fantasy. There are no huge plot points that are not created by the characters' interaction. Whether they are warring, backstabbing, screwing, avenging... everything in this book is driven by an amazing cast of characters. I found myself taking my time but wanting to know what happened next so damn bad my slow reading pace was killing me. Also, there are hints at things in side stories and small glimpses of what to come. And I can't wait! I'm going to take a small break from Martin but I've already bought Clash of Kings and can't wait to leap back in.If you've been hemming and hawing about reading his books, stop, and read them.

      "Corresponding review: My wife and I are birders and are always on the look for a camera with great zooming ability that is still sufficiently light to carry. We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth. Total weight with the T-1204X is about 2.5lbSIRUI G-10 29mm Ballhead with Quick Release, 40 lbs Load Capacity- Canon remote switch: to avoid shaking caused by pushing the shutter release button.Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3 ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: speakers are very powerful\n",
      "Human answer: volume adjustable\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the volume of the unit?\n",
      "Corresponding review: These speakers ROCK. I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the \"sweet spot\" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of \"small\" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: There are multiple pros and cons to this restaurant. In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!The vibe:-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.The drinks:-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. The food:-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? My overall impression:-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words. The portions are small and that is somewhat against the whole concept of Southern comfort food but it was nice not feeling completely filled to the brim for once. Overall a 3.5/5 but I'll give it a 4 because it's worth a shot! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I could say its the most flavorful gelato I've ever had. The texture was just right, not too creamy feeling and not too watery. Just enough for you to keep it in your mouth for the full flavor. So tasty; definitely recommending everyone and anyone to try this if you haven't already! Its really hidden and its the same street as guu ! Definitely look for it!Update: so my sister decided to buy boxes of gelato from here back home where we live in Markham. The black sesame is full of flavor as well as durian. However, I fully believe that Durian has a distinct flavor and smell to it that people may not prefer but it is worth to try. Their newest flavor is the Jasmine tea and the HK milk tea. So good!!!

      "Corresponding question: What do you think about my performance?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Having quickly become a modern classic on stage and in acting circles, Closer-the film is also a landmark.Thirty years removed from Carnal Knowledge, Mike Nichols deftly guides this present day expose of how men and women damage each other in relationships, how impulse and instinct conflict with emotion and the heart, truly the ultimate of matters for us all.The acting is stellar, in particular Portman and Owen (both nominated for Academy Awards) as the initial foils for their partners Law and Roberts, respectively. But these are equal opportunity betrayals, put over on each other over the course of four years. The use of Damien Rice's \"O,\" the direction by Nichols, and the film adapted screenplay by the play's writer/creator Patrick Marber are also excellent.This isn't remotely a comedy, despite moments of levity-particularly Owen-and is a sad case for the complexity of cosmopolitan culture and attitude, an absence of obescense and perspective other than whimsy and vengeance-traits that usually result in damage, especially in relationships.Such an expose, an introspection, an analysis makes this the standout it is. This will hold up over time too, because simple, direct subjects, like how and why and what happens when people struggle against each other in intimate relationships, is a subject that will never be tired.

After noting this I found other reviews and forum comments with this same complaint.Tamron evidently needs to update the firmware to communicate better with the 5D Mark III (and perhaps other bodies as well).

      "Corresponding review: I was traveling on business but with a significant other, so this trip was as much a vacation as anything. I booked this hotel on Priceline for a quarter what it was selling for on the open market. From what I can tell Priceliners usually get a very cramped room with no view in the &quot;old&quot; section. That was still fine with me, as the spectacular location, gorgeous public spaces, fantastic staff, and Heavenly Bed and Bath were good enough for me. And regardless, for about $60 a night they would have upgrading into the newer section (still a good value). We checked in late and, I'm assuming as a result, were given an upgraded room in the &quot;new&quot; tower on a high floor. It was magnificent. Spacious, clean, modern and with great views of San Francisco... it transformed out trip. As I mentioned, all Westin rooms (including this one) had wonderful beds and bathrooms. The front desk staff was friendly and more importantly polished - something I find less and less of these days. The room service, cleaning staff, and doormen were all excellent as well. I find the reviews complaining about extra charges at a four star hotel a little lame. It is, in fact, really annoying to pay high fees for internet, the business center, parking, fitness, breakfast etc. However that high end hotels charge for these services is no secret - avoiding them is a big part of why so many business travelers stay at places like Courtyard or Hilton Garden Inn. While those hotels might be a better value, they simply cannot touch the heritage and, frankly, class of the Westin St. Francis and its staff. They actually succeeded in turning a hotel stay into a memorable experience for my partner and me - something very hard to come by for otherwise budget travelers. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Our room was on the first level of accommodation, near the end of the hallway above a banquet room. Traffic noise wasn't a problem for us, but the room was also accessible through our window via the flat roof of the banquet room, so security was a concern if we left our window open. The plumbing in this particular room was also very loud with pipes creaking and waking us up every night. The staff tried to identify the problem, but weren't able to sort if out while we were there.

For some reason I did not \"feel\" a strong caffeine effect after drinking this. And while the drink tasted sweet, the Stevia sweetener left a very bitter aftertaste.

      "Corresponding review: This book was a big surprise. My ratings stay below 5 unless it's among the best books I know. The story is captivating. I loved it. The writing is outstanding. Even though it's fantasy sci-fi, it's logical, makes sense and has great insights and lessons. I was able to anticipate several things, which is a good thing - it didn't go off on some lame tangent attempting a plot twist fail. There are interesting stories within the story. Stephanie is a very talented writer and we're lucky to have her. She does write from a female perspective (slightly girly), but that's hardly noticeable. Mainly, the male behavior and lack of male considerations like leadership or security (in this context) were more of an external way a girl might think/observe a guy as opposed to realistic male thinking or behavior. The only thing I thought this book lacked was an opening background chapter to give better setting and perspective. The opening is hard to follow and I got the same complaint from a young less experienced reader (who kind of lost interest over it). It's like you wake up looking through a microscope with no context for what you're observing, so disorienting might be a better description. You don't want to lose readers of such a fantastic book with that kind of opening. The very ending also was short on details to make it more plausible and believable - specifically, how they were \"found\".I can see why they were quick to make a movie of this book - it could be really good. Hopefully, the same level of attention and budget as the twilight films, as it could be really bad too. I am really looking forward to the movie and am glad that I finished the book first, because I know there's no way to fit all of the story in. Either way - movie or not - read the book!

      "Wrong annotation: banter was always witty\n",
      "Human answer: bloggers Drew\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the banter?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I had heard about Tangled a while back when it was self published.  It seemed that many bloggers were enjoying Drew's story tremendously.  Then, my good bloggy friend, Nereyda, from Mostly YA Book Obsessed, highly recommended it, and I added it to the top of my TBR.  When I was offered the book for review, I quickly snatched it up, and crossed my fingers that it would live up to all of the hype, and believe me, it did!  At the end of the book, we even get a short little excerpt leading in to the next installment, Twisted, which will be told from the female character's point of view, Kate.If you have been in a reading funk or are looking for something to lift your spirits, look no further.  Tangled is such a fun, humorous, sexy, and romantic story!  I found myself chuckling and full out laughing throughout this story.  It was highly entertaining, as it was told through Drew's view point; a sexy, intelligent, ambitious, and cocky womanizer, who always gets what he wants, when he wants it!  Drew was such a colorful, witty, and fun character that completely had me engaged, as he told his candid story of falling in love for the very first time.  I loved reading from the male point of view.  This story felt authentic, and it would be perfect for the big screen!At the beginning of the story, we get a devastated Drew, who is heart broken, (though he claims he's just sick with the flu) because things did not work out with Kate, (the woman he fell in love with.)  He then flashes back to the first time he met Kate, and tells us the story of how he fell in love, and ended up in his present state.  Along the way, we are entertained by Drew's factoids on the way the male brain works, the life he led before he met Kate, and how everything changed for him when she entered his life.  Kate was a fabulous character.  She was strong, independent, witty, intelligent, and ambitious.  When Drew and Kate were in the same scenes, fireworks always erupted.  Whether it was from sexual tension, these two competing against one another through work sabotage, or hot love scenes, the excitement never ended!  It was fun watching the verbal foreplay between Drew and Kate.  These two loved to argue, but their banter was always witty, fun, passionate, and humorous.I enjoyed getting to know the side characters as well.  Alexandra, also know as, &#34;The Bitch,&#34; was Drew's sister, and I loved how all the guys were intimidated by her.  She was such a strong woman, and I had the utmost respect for her character.  Her husband, Steven, was a good friend, husband, and father, but it was obvious who ruled their marriage.  McKenzie, Drew's niece, was a sweet, cute, and inquisitive, 4 year old little dynamo.  She was the apple of Drew's eye, and had me smiling, and laughing whenever she made an appearance.  She had a tendency to repeat everything verbatim, which got Drew into hot water with his sister, quite a few times in the story.  Matthew, Drew's and Steven's other good friend, was a womanizer as well.  In fact, Drew and Matthew were partner's in crime when they went out together on Saturday nights to pick up women at various clubs and bars.  Matthew ends up meeting Kate's best friend, Dolores, (Dee Dee) who give's Alexandra a run for her money in the strong woman department. I loved watching Dee Dee put Drew in his place, as she tried to protect Kate from getting hurt.  She was a loyal friend, and fun character.  We are going to get Dee Dee and Matthew's story in an upcoming installment, Tamed, and I can't wait!!!!My Rating:If you haven't already guessed, I LOVED Tangled, by Emma Chase, and highly recommend it!!!!  The entertainment, flair, and humor in the story reminded me a lot of Wallbanger, by Alice Clayton.  If you enjoyed Wallbanger, I guarantee that Tangled will be a much loved read for you as well.  If you are looking for an instant hit to add to your reading shelf, add Tangled!  You won't be disappointed.  I give Tangled, by Emma Chase, 5 Spectacular, Swoony, Fun, Laugh-Out-Loud Stars!My Favorite Quote:&#34;Women fall in love quicker than men.  Easier and more often.  But when guys fall?  We go down harder.  And when things go bad?  When it's not us who ends it?  We don't get to walk away.  We crawl.&#34;  (Paperback, Pg. 150)~Drew*To Read More Book Reviews, Visit A Bookish Escape ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We chose this hotel because it was within a short distance from the Theatre we were attending that night. The check in process took over an hour with short tempered check-in staff. The check-in line was very long with only 2 staff members checking them in. The lobby was full of luggage piled in and around the check-in line and we noticed several people tripping over them. The bell staff stood around talking and even though they saw the luggage they did nothing to move it out of the way. After attending the theater that evening we returned to the hotel and all of the hotel restaurants, bars, snack bars were closed. The front desk said if we wanted any refreshments we would have to purchase them from the vending machines on each floor. Since the hotel did not provide room service and the area around the hotel was scary for seniors we were unable to get even a bottle of water and the vending machines on all the floor were out of water. The room was okay but had a old, musty smell and the bathroom was very small. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Firstly, I thought I'd be getting a box of these thru Vine, but once I tasted this bar, I wasn't disappointed any more that I only got one. I did think it rather humorous, however, that this huge box contained one little bar.These smell really good, probably due to the fruit juice used as the sugar source in them. And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries, moreso than most \"blueberry\" products. But that's where the pleasurable parts end. The texture is like someone sat on your Great Aunt's fruitcake on a long trip to Oshkosh and then gave you a slice. It seems compacted and gooey. Nothing you'd want more than one of. Ever.Solution to factory-made bars? I have been making my own for about 3 months now. I use whole wheat flour, wheat germ, whole oats, vanilla, bananas, dates, raisins, figs, dried cranberries, hazelnuts, coconut, honey, eggs and brown sugar. Sometimes I add bits of organic chocolate. That's it. I bake them for about an hour and they are light, fluffy, chewy and fantastic. They only take about 10 minutes to mix up and cost about 2/3rds less than a box of granola bars and I get about 3 times more bars. And each one is practically a meal because I cut them large.Why can I do this so cheaply, quickly and easily, yet a food factory with a big budget can't seem to make a decent granola bar? Overhead and corporate silliness, I guess. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I've been watching Blu-Ray films on my PS3 for several years now, and I figure I have a pretty good eye for quality transfers.  This is one.  The initial few scenes are a bit grainy, but I think it was due to the limitations of shooting from a portable camera from a helicopter in 1959.  I'll forgive the grain.  But once the scenes move to the amazing expanses of the Austrian countryside I was blown away.  The clarity is phenomenal.  Even sparkles on the water were vivid.  Plus, the sound is amazing as well.  Bravo on the Blu-Ray.Of note:  this set apparently did not generate as much interest initially so the price has dropped.  I picked it up in the gold box for $18.99.  I have noted the contents and whether they are worthy:4 disc collection: film on Blu-Ray with some features (including a sing along version!), another Blu-Ray of special features, the DVD film version, and a CD soundtrack.The music box plays \"My Favorite Things\" but it plays a bit fast.  It is small-ish, maybe 3\" x 2\" x 2\" or so.  But it has space for some rings or a locket or some other 'favorite thing'.  It says hand painted, but it looks like it was painted from a stencil.  It is a stoneware style, so that is nice.The two books are the great additions to the set.  They have a special feature book (soft cover) and then a production bio (hardcover).The last things are a certificate of authenticity and some post cards.The entire set comes in a stiff cardboard box with a cardboard sleeve around it.  You can remove the sleeve (which has a couple of small pictures showing the contents) and the inner box is clean and looks like the picture.All in all a great set for fans of the film.  For under $20 it is one of the best finds I stumbled across this holiday season.  Even at $30 it is worthy.  If you don't care for the extras, there is a Blu-Ray special edition that is basically the movie with the 3 discs (not including soundtrack):The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging).  I recommend the boxed set for fans or as a gift, but the other version is great for those who just want to enjoy the film.One of the truly remarkable films on Blu-Ray to this date.  Simply marvelous, epic, and breathtaking.  Now I'm buying Lawrence of Arabia next! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Hotel CarltonWhy is it a Good place?- very reasonably priced downtown hotel - we paid about $150 USD (including valet parking that was $30 extra) per night.- friendly, smiley and helpful staff that are very nice and polite.- clean rooms with excellent maid service.- free high-speed internet.- HBO and a decent selection of cable (yeah yeah who watches TV on vacation - this guy - sometimes... becase it beats the heck out of socializing with other guests in the lobby)- desk to work on in the room.- nice boutique feel to the whole hotel.What's wrong with the Carlton?- it's nearly impossible to say anything bad about the place because of the really friendly, smiley and helpful staff that are very nice and polite.... but I'm a bit of a jerk - so here are the cons anyway:- the rooms are very small (however, what the heck do you expect for the price in a major city, in a downtown hotel?).- you need a car or lots of cab or busfare money because despite being downtown there is nothing to see or do within a ten minute walk.- the bathroom in our room was a little beat up (still clean though) and the soap, shampoo and conditioner were in a dispenser mounted to the wall (like you'd find in a health club shower). This was a real inconvenience since my wife always takes the complimentary bath products from hotels. I found it quite difficult to pry the dispenser thing off the wall to take home. The front desk was again very helpful though and provided me with a flathead screwdriver to get the job done. - no gym - you have to pay 15 bucks to use a gym in the area. Having to pay 15 bucks and leave the hotel to find the gym was enough to convince me that I didn't really feel like working out.What's the deal with the guests chilling in the lobby?- For some unknown reason guests seemed to be always hanging out in the lobby... eating pizzas, sitting in front of the fireplace, drinking beverages, talking to each other, and reading the coffee table books.- I guess this is one of those things that makes the hotel feel super &quot;boutiquey&quot;?- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE:- the rooms are really small; or because they serve wine at 5:30 p.m. for free in the lobby and people mull around til midnight; or because the staff are very friendly helpful, polite and super nice.- OR : - travellers on a tight budget?- thought it was weird but then again I'm not into bonding with other hotel guests.Overall - a solid place to stay in San Francisco - all my complaints are pretty superficial - I'd go back and stay at the friendly Carlton. It is what it is and for the price I think it would be difficult to find a better hotel. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Much like Richard Dawkins is an inflammatory character, so is the title of his most well known book. For people such as myself who are not religious, his passion for helping humanity move beyond superstitious dogma so as to allow in a more complex, complete, and exhilarating understanding of the world and universe in which we exist does not appear offensive. However, I can appreciate why people who are of a religious persuasion would feel inclined to steer clear of Dawkins and his writing. Yet, I would encourage those people to cast aside their initial disgust and discomfort with the author and title, because, if one has an open mind this book will provide illuminating intellectual reading, and if one does not yet have an open mind, this is just the sort of reading that may begin to break down the barriers of closed-mindedness.I believe if you are going to get anything out of this book you'll have to read it in order, as skipping around could easily leave you either not understanding things, or upset you to the point of not picking the book back up. If you do choose to read it, and you do read it in order and in full, I don't think you'll be disappointed, and I can almost assure that only the most closed-minded individuals will find themselves upset at what they've taken in.Dawkins will challenge you to think about things in a new way. He'll challenge you to wonder why religious beliefs are not held to the same standards of scrutiny and given more than customary respect. That's the first key. In order to appreciate any of his points you have to be willing to give up the \"religious beliefs are not to be questioned, scrutinized, or challenged on grounds that such is disrespectful\" attitude.  From there you will be challenged to consider the black and white nature with which we have drawn religious arguments. Instead of \"believer,\" \"agnostic\" and \"atheist\" he challenges you to rightly think of all people as agnostics, in the sense none of us can know if God is real or not. He'll also try and make you understand that there is a false equivalency pertaining to religious and non-religious beliefs. Religious beliefs are spectacular claims with no supporting evidence, and although they could be true, it's not non-believers job to disprove the non evidentiary based claims of religion, but rather believers job to demonstrate why exactly they say we should believe in these things for which there is no evidence.From there, you will go on a journey of pseudo-evidence. You'll look at all sorts of unscientific claims that religious people hold up as \"proof of God.\" Everything from \"the world is beautiful\" to \"I feel God in my life\" to \"something so perfect has to be real,\" to \"here's a really smart person who believes,\" to \"our existence is unlikely,\" etc, etc. Dawkins forces you to think with scientific rationality instead of hopeful dogma. The fact things are perceived as beautiful, improbable, complex, or whatever else doesn't somehow mean that it's more likely for some all powerful deity to exist. We are so conditioned to view anything that is unusually good, bad, confusing, or unknown in both our individual lives and our world, as proof of an arbitrarily presupposed supernatural creator that we never stop to think, \"hey maybe things can be really pretty, or really complicated, or whatever else without their being some magical creator.\"This will transition nicely to when he subsequently talks about how the unknown, which we use as \"proof of God,\" allowed the notion of God to exist in the first place. As a scientist, Dawkins understands that his trade is aimed at finding gaps in our knowledge, and using the scientific method to discover answers to what we previously did not know. Religion is what serves as a placeholder for yet unanswered questions or not fully understood phenomenon. With this understanding in mind, Dawkins proposes that science is viewed as the enemy of religion precisely because it is indeed the thing that kills religion. When you understand how things work, when the question is answered, then the answer can no longer be, \"God.\" He fully acknowledges how some people view science as merely \"revealing\" the ways of God, but he heavily implies that this is illogical, as the ways of God that religions talk about are very different indeed from the actual answers science ends up providing.Yet, aside from the \"filler of holes\" concept, Dawkins challenges you to consider where religion comes from. In my opinion he does a poor job of answering this question, which might be explained by the fact he is an evolutionary biologist. He works with how life has evolved, rather than how it started (that will ultimately be the job of chemists as opposed to biologists as he points out). Thus, he makes some very good insights into how religion has spread and why it persists (sort of the evolution of the perpetuation of religion), but he fails to come up with, or really even attempt to come up with, a theory as to where the human desire to create the religions it did originates from. As for how it is perpetuated he talks about the role of parents and other social institutions enforcing religious beliefs as truths in impressionable young minds, such that it becomes cyclical and immune to analytical, scientific reasoning.After considering all this (that religion should be challenged like anything, that agnosticism is false equivalency, that the \"proofs\" for God are not actually evidence in any kind of scientific, logical, or intellectual sense, and a consideration of where religion came from, with its basic function) the rest of the book focuses on a refutation of religious apologies. Basically, Dawkins points out the obvious (that there is no evidence for God and that it's beyond unlikely one actually exists), but he acknowledges that whether or not God is actually real or not is the improper question to ask of most people. For most people it is not \"is God real?\" but rather, \"ought we believe in God, real or not?\" He'll talk about morality and how so many people assume it takes religion to instill and enforce a sense of right and wrong in people. Yet, he understands that scientifically this is not so, due to his background in evolutionary psychology. He understands that what we know as right and wrong is a byproduct of the sort of personality traits that were chosen during the course of sexual selection to help our intelligent, social species better survive. In other words, people who are alive today had the ancestors whose personalities saw right and wrong in the way most all people today do, and they survived because their social moral codes worked out best for humans. Ironically, this concept of \"natural law\" (i.e. we all have this fairly uniform sense of morality) is often used by religious people as proof of God. (basically, hey if we all have this sense of right and wrong there must have been a deity that put this sense in all of us....you can see why creationists and people who understand and accept the science of evolution have such problems with each other) The implications of our morality coming from our DNA rather than from an adherence to religious texts is, to Dawkins, (and to many such as myself) the sort of proof that, yes, everyone will be just as good without religion.Expanding off of this concept, Dawkins will go on to describe how social memes (basically the zeitgeist) evolve in an inevitably progressive direction over time (overall, as there can be temporary setbacks along the overall progressive trend). It is for this precise reason, he asserts, that more and more of things like the Torah, the Bible, and the Koran are no longer adhered to today. Our morality exists because of evolution, which also means it's always evolving (it's why we have the evolution of the zeitgeist). Of course, this, despite making very good sense, is a problem for religious people, as social memes become more progressive as humanity grows and matures with evolution, despite religious writings remaining fixed in the less mature, less progressive times they were written. A conflict erupts between those people that want to continue to adhere to larger amounts of various religious writings based on a whimsical assumption they are a sort of absolute truth with a capital T, and the rest of people who will allow our moral evolution to continue to improve with time and experience as a species. As impolite as it might sound (since we are accustomed to giving religion such high levels of respect and insulation from scrutiny) belief in the perfection of scripture creates an obstacle for the evolution of humanity's moral progress.To really drive home the point that our morality comes from ourselves rather than some scriptures attributed to some deity, Dawkins talks about how things we today see as the \"good parts\" of something such as the Bible, like \"love thy neighbor\" or \"thou shall not kill,\" are actually just as misleading as something like \"we the people\" in our Constitution. Things like thou shall not kill were meant to say \"thou shall not kill Jews\" much in the way \"people\" used to mean only white male property owners. Yet, today religious people interpret these Biblical rules to be more inclusive and tolerant. They do this not because the meanings of the Bible suddenly changed, but because the people reading them did. We evolve, our morality evolves, and it improves. Which is precisely why it is ridiculous that we hold up a book like the Bible that talks about ritual human sacrifices, stoning of women, killing people who work on Sunday, giving your daughter's virginity to as retribution to save a man from being anally raped, etc, etc, as some sort of \"code of our morality.\" The fact we can pick and choose the \"good\" and \"bad\" parts is demonstrative that it's been us, humans, not some divine intervention all along.From there, Dawkins will talk about what he perceives as the damage religion creates. He basically subscribes to the idea that good people will be good and bad people bad with or without religion, but only with religion will good people do bad. I and others aren't so sure of that, although there is a strong circumstantial case to be made. However, I do regret that Dawkins goes on such a lengthy, albeit incredibly well articulated bashing of his perceived horrors of religion, as I feel it will turn too many otherwise open intellectual, scientifically minded people away from the larger message of the book, which is that freedom of thought should always trump dogma. Obviously he jumps into the homosexuality thing, as it really is one of those things no one would be against if not for religion. Yet, I find this part of the book, at least given what the book's larger objective is, to be rather unnecessary. The discussion of the religious objection to abortion is more interesting; although still not something I would have gone after if I were attempting to do what Dawkins was. The notion of consequentialism (what are the consequences of permitting or not permitting this action) vs. the notion of absolutism (this action shall be permitted or not permitted based on an absolute, predetermined labeling of the thing as \"good\" or \"bad\" based on my religion) is a riveting one, but I think it is only such if you are already intellectually enlightened prior to the picking up of Dawkins' writing. I further believe he makes a mistake in demonizing \"moderate\" religion, and nearly suggesting that it is as much not a real thing as \"50/50 agnocisticsm\" is. Moderate religious belief may not be any less scientifically implausible and ridiculous than extremist religious belief, but if we are truly asking ourselves if we ought to be militant atheists or atheists with a religiously libertarian attitude to the unenlightened world, I think a consideration of the lesser damages of moderate religion should be better considered (he seems to view people like Ted Haggard as \"moderate\" by American standards, perhaps a disillusioned view of the extremeness of American religiosity coming from a Brit that thinks we are worse than we really are)After taking this detour to talk about the bad of religion, Dawkins comes back to a far more convincing \"ought we to\" argument. The question is whether we ought to raise children religiously (which is basically a form of indoctrination, no matter how mild the upbringing may be). He points out the absurdity of labeling kids by their parents religion (you would never do that with their parent's political or economic opinions). He also points out that while physical abuse is horrible, abuse of the mind leaves far longer lasting scars. I think the way in which he makes the point is very sloppy and perhaps even unknowingly offensive, as he compares the Catholic priest scandal to indoctrinating of minds and calls the latter worse (as well as discussing the story of a woman who said she had been more traumatized as child by thinking her dead friend was burning in hell for being the wrong religion than she was by being sexually abused by a priest). Overall, I'm not sure I can come to think of any form of religious indoctrination as worse than sexual exploitation of minors, but I can appreciate that even when a household is open minded and intellectual and the parents fully accepting of whatever their children end up believing later on (as was the case with mine) being raised religious still leaves you with a nasty feeling that you've done something wrong, that you failed your parents, that they'd be happier if they you had turned out as they intended, or even that somehow you are indicating to them you don't think of them as good people since you ended up believing in different things than they did.On a tamer note, Dawkins goes on to make the distinction between teaching about religion and teaching religion. Much as we learn of Greek and Roman mythology so that we may understand the literary gems of the day, Dawkins asserts that we do need to explore contemporary western religious for literary purposes. Yet, he couples this with a harsh discussion of how trying to teach religious dogma in place of or in refutation of sound science is perhaps the worst form of intellectual child abuse.The book concludes with an examination of the most powerful \"ought we\" question. Even if it's beyond unlikely there is a God for which there is no sound evidence, ought we to believe in it, or at least socially protect the belief in such, not because it will save our morality, or because it fails to harm, or because parents should be left to teach their kids as they choose (religion does not make our morality, it's not without harm, and parental indoctrination is, in fact, one such harm), but rather because it provides an ability to comfort, console, and inspire humanity? In trying to answer this question Dawkins first concedes that the notion of God does comfort, console, and inspire people. By doing this, he appears to unknowingly answer the question he earlier failed to answer (from where does religion come?). Religion, it would seem comes from adults who couldn't give up the security of an unconditional, loving, helpful friend that always has time to be there for you. In other words, as impolite as it sounds, religion allows adults to have that imaginary friend when times call for it. Dawkins speaks of a story of a woman who says she had an imaginary friend as a child who she later had a dream about as an adult where the friend (a sort of Barney-like purple creature) was giving her advice as to how to navigate a crisis in her life. He quite profoundly postulates that this adult extension of childhood friends is at the essence of belief in deities.So, then the question becomes whether or not we can be consoled and inspired while acknowledging that our adult imaginary friend known as God is just as unlikely to exist as any childhood imaginary friend. He suggests we most certainly can and invokes quantum mechanics and an unnamed reference to biocentric perception as the reason why. Basically, we evolved to perceive the world as we do because that's what we needed to perceive in order to successfully navigate it. Yet, there is much in this universe, and other proposed universes that is far too small, too large, too fast, too slow, and whatever else for us to perceive let alone understand. The world we see is such a tiny bit of reality and such a limited understanding of all there is to understand. With science, we can discover realities in which we do not exist and come to understand all the things within our reality that we do not perceive. He uses the amazing analogy of a woman in a burka with only the slit where her eyes are being exposed. He instructs us to imagine that the woman and the burka covering her are miles upon miles tall/long. Because modern science has begun to discover both how long the burka of reality really is and also figuring out ways to understand the rest of the burka, the tiny slit humanity has previously been confined to perceive things from is rapidly opening up. Thus, it becomes apparent to us readers that we can very much be inspired by all these new components of vast, vast reality that there is to be investigated, and we can very much be comforted by increasing our understanding of this vast reality. We can obtain this inspiration and comfort by using science, which yes, does destroy old superstitious dogmas we found comforting in the face of uncertainty from the slit of the burka, but what there is to find, in exchange for giving up the comparatively smaller comfort and inspiration that was the religious placeholder, is so, so much greater than what we got from our delusions.

      "Corresponding review: If you are going to introduce a new Bond, what better way to do it than go back to the beginning? This is exactly what Martin Cambell did in Daniel's Craig first movie as the beloved 007. We find a Bond at the start of his career, having recently attained the 00 status, and showing a personality that differs from what we are used to seeing from this character. I am not going to lie to you, Sean Connery still is, and probably will always be, my favorite Bond, but Craig comes pretty close to the Master. And he is undoubtedly better than the last couple of actors that attempted the feat of portraying one of the most charismatic secret agents ever.This time around, the plot takes us from Madagascar to the Bahamas. In the process we find bankers stealing money from Freedom Fighters, bomb-makers with clear and important targets in mind, a fair amount of poker playing, and of course, attractive women. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the differences in Bond's personality compared to the other movies. Here we can see how his attitude towards women changed and the reasons behind this. Also, there are many details that if you have watched the previous Bond productions you will not see in this one. Even though one of these shows up towards the end, you will miss several Bond traits that are always present. It is fun to go through the movie spotting these absences.The action scenes are exciting and even though they are unrealistic, as is usually the case with Bond movies, this aspect was toned down from the latest efforts. The high speed chase on foot in Madagascar is remarkable and very well filmed, and even though it runs for a fair amount of time, we do not get bored in the least. As I already mentioned, there is also quite a bit of poker playing. This is only natural, seeing the popularity this game has gained lately. The good news is that they managed to keep these scenes interesting and they fit well with the rest of the plot.Just when I was ready to accept that there will never be a James Bond that will make me want to see these movies again, I was pleasantly surprised by Craig. I am looking forward to his next effort and hope that we get many more at this level. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: 3.5 STARSFor someone who isn't a fan of Thai food, Khao San Road did exceptionally well in providing a fun dining experience.  The place was on fire as it was jammed from 6:30 onward.  People were coming in and out waiting for take out, waiting for tables, watching our food jealously as their stomachs rumbled.We had a table of 8 so we ordered a lot of apps to start.  The shrimp chips were decently crispy with a nice peppery flavour that lingered on the tongue. The squash chips on the other hand were not as flavourful or exciting, very mild and safe; same sauce for both which was a little boring.  Deep fired sweet potato thingies were okay nothing special.  The salad hand rolls were pretty refreshing as I don't usually like these things, but they were so clean and honest I ate more than I wanted.  Was not a huge fan of their coconut milk, mushroom, basil, chicken soup.  To be fair I don't like coconut milk as it's too sweet for my tastes, but there was something extremely bitter in mine and it was completely off putting.  Everyone else at the table loved it, so it might've just been me.The fried tofu was absolutely delicious!  SUPER flavourful, crispy and utterly mouth watering.  Really surprised when I casually tossed one in my mouth.  Might just be the best tofu I've eaten in a restaurant.  Bam.Onto the mains.  I got the Pad Gra Prao (minced beef on rice with fired egg on top) and it was pretty tasty.  Nothing wow, but a simple, solid, decently made dish.  I wish my egg was bigger, runnier and more awesome.  Should've asked for 3.The braised beef curry was a total disappointment.  The sauce was good. noodles were okay but the beef was tough and chewy, very sad to eat.The best dish of the night was hands down their green thai curry.  Now that was a fantastically put together dish with so many flavours, perfect heat, creamy-ness, coconuty-ness, tender chicken-ness.  Going from one dish to the next, it was clear that this one was in a league of it's own.  A god among peons.There were more dishes but after a while Thai food ends up tasting the same to me.  Blasphemous to some, but truth for me.  I can handle only so much coconut and peanut in one sitting.One knock I have on the place that is completely irrational is their menu.  It's written in such a way that I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted.  First, the Thai names were of no use to me, and neither were the English phonetics.  The descriptions of all the dishes seemed to start off the same with 'coconut milk curry, and ended with beef $ / chicken $'.  Yes I was super tired and I didn't want to read, but c'mon, make it easier on me =/Verdict: the best Thai food I've had in Toronto.  Khao San is more than just hype, it's legit. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: If you have a big house with multiple floors and/or outdoor areas of your home where you would like to receive good wifi coverage, this is a great choice for a range extender.  Probably would be a good primary router as well, but I use it as a range extender. I now get 3 bars downstairs where I used to get zero signal, and 4 bars out on the deck.I wish I could say the set up was easy, but because my wifi router is 7 years old and was set to WEP security it wasn't the simplest to get it to work. I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again. No need to reconfigure anything.It's also quite small and sleek looking, so not an eyesore in the middle of the kitchen (the halfway point in my house).  I like it so much that when I decide to retire my old router I will definitely be getting a second one of these. It's signal is also not quite strong enough to cover my entire property with just one (has range of 100 ft), but with two of them I'll be in great shape.Special bonus, if you are a T-mobile cell user, you already know you can use your wifi connection to make calls and send texts/surf the web. So extending your wifi range to all of your property, not just where your computer is, will be even more worthwhile.  Just be sure to unplug all this wireless stuff when everyone goes to bed at night if you're going to amp up the coverage so that it's hitting the bedrooms too. You'll sleep better.

      "Corresponding review: I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that \"The Passion of the Christ\" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.\"The Passion of the Christ\" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any.

This movie... was better than some of his, and I did appreciate some attention to detail... the way the ship was made, and parts of it operated kept my attention... but the plot of the movie itself was very narrow and linear... and didn't really offer any surprises... or anticipation for what you thought might be coming, either.  It felt as if it had already happened, 20 minutes in, and one spent the rest of the movie waiting for the inevitabilities to catch up with you.  I'm also, I have to say, getting a bit weary of the automatic 'evil = ugly = evil' equation and irretrievable and singleminded adversaries thing.

      "Corresponding review: I loved this book. LOVED.I went into it a bit wary because of the hype - I'd heard so much about it, so many GOOD things, that I was afraid my expectations were too high. In the end, my expectations WERE high, but the book met them, if not quite in the ways I thought.I saw Erin Morgenstern say on Twitter and in interviews many times (to the point where she started to sound annoyed, but I don't blame her) that the book is neither YA nor a series, despite how it has been portrayed in some reviews/stories. Both of these things is true. It is not YA, though a teen would certainly enjoy it since it's not like teens read nothing but YA (or that adults DON'T read YA). And to me, it utterly stands alone. I can't even see where a sequel would go, with the caveat that there is such a beautiful world here that it could be explored in perhaps entirely different stories. What I would like to see more than a sequel would be short stories, honestly.Because it is truly the world in this book that is magnificent - not the &#34;world&#34; at large as in Harry Potter or Dresden Files or other books with complicated mechanics of magic, but instead the microcosm of the circus that is painted so beautiful. In all honesty the characters fell much flatter for me than I would typically tolerate in my fiction, but I came to realize that they were really playing second fiddle to the setting as the protagonist.My one serious complaint would be that the time jumping makes it difficult to follow - a problem that was exacerbated by the fact that I was listening to the book on audio and couldn't flip back to see how much time had passed, what time period I was in, etc. For that reason, even though the narration is beautifully done by Jim Dale, I might recommend reading it in hardcopy.Though reviews liked to compare the book to Harry Potter, it reminds me much more in feel if to anything, Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. It's very adult (in terms of maturity, not theme) and very Victorian. The book picks up momentum as it goes along, not unlike a train, and all of the loose ends begin to tie together at the end masterfully.Don't get scared away by the hype - read this because it's gorgeous.

      "Corresponding review: Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre.  Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance.  The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind.  I am a big fan of science fiction!  Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer.  I was not disappointed with this film!  Oblivion is a film that makes you think.  When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on.  When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together.  I like science fiction films that can do that.  This film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone.  It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.The special effects of this movie are fantastic.  This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it.  The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about.  Morgan Freeman's character is also likable.  The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning.  There is not much action in this movie either.  The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it.  The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is.  However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the compartment?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I recently bought the Slingshot 302AW, hoping to be able to carry two bodies (and some extra lenses and accessories) and still enjoy the fast access of a sling bag.But I cannot find the right configuration for this bag. It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment.

It is slow, but I don't notice it as I run on auto back-up.If you need to wait while copying files often, get a faster one.Summary: good price for a SLOW 32gb usb drive.

      "Corresponding review: Stayed here for about a week in August. Booked through Priceline, so the front desk didn't give us a very high floor, and put us in a ADA room (besides the grab bars in the tub, it wasn't so bad). We had a decent view of Union Square and a sliding door leading out to a hazardous balcony. Room was fine but could have used a little more warmth and furniture (the ADA rooms are a bit bigger and emptier). There is a lounge and restaurant on the top floor with great 360 views of the city. The hotel is very conveniently located, with good bus service and close to the Powell St. BART and MUNI stop. But the surrounding neighborhood isn't much fun at night and food is limited, although Chinatown is a 10 minute walk. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the quality of the movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: in my mind,Batman Begins is easily one of the best superhero movies ever made.the movie basically tells the story of the genesis of the caped crusader.obviously,there is a fair amount of character development involved,which you would expect based on the title.but not so much that the film becomes tedious.Batman is shown as more of a full dimensional character than in previous incarnations..Director Christopher Nolan shows great skill as a director,pacing the film very well.there are also some touches of humour throughout and we get to see a more human side to Bruce Wayne.The villains are also more fully realized than in most movies of the genre,instead of simply being devices for the hero(the protagonist)to have a villain(antagonist)to defeat.Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are standouts in their respective roles,as is Liam Neeson.Katie Holmes has yet to reach the level of maturity require for her role,so she is a bit weak.This Batman movie is less cartoonish than previous efforts,and is closer to the realm of realism(relatively speaking).the movie is also more thoughtful than many movies depicting superheros.there is much more substance.in fact more substance than style,though it is just stylistic enough.All in all a brilliant depiction of the origin of the caped crusader. 5/5 ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Stayed over President's Day weekend as a birthday surprise for my girlfriend. It was enjoyable and memorable.The hotel is in a wonderful location at the top of Nob Hill. We had upgraded to an upper floor room with city view, which cannot be beat. The valet service and the check-in were friendly and efficient, with our package details clearly spelled out. However, there was a snafu with the bags and I ended up having to go back downstairs to get them myself. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The room size was fairly small, not surprising for an older hotel but adequate for 2 people. Elevators were a bit slow, but acceptable considering the property is 80 years old.The Top of the Mark was great for late evening drinks (no kids allowed, drinks average $10 and proper dress is expected) with wonderful nighttime views of the city. Breakfast was outstanding, a high quality buffet with panaromic views stretching from downtown to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. There is a cable car stop outside which can get you around, otherwise you are looking at a VERY steep walk to get down to Union Square and a real killer to walk back up Powell to California Street. Checkout was a bit slow, but all charges were clearly explained, unlike some earlier posters who seemed to have problems. Maybe it helps to be an InterContinental member. The car was waiting outside with no delay.Overall, if you like a place with history and class, this is a great place to stay. The package value I received was outstanding, for $219 a great room, parking ($50) and breakfast for two ($52 value) included. Classic architecture, romantic history and a fabulous view of a wonderful city make for a memorable stay. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: This is another in the \" Midnite Movies \" releases\n",
      "Corresponding question: Where can I print a movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is another in the \"Midnite Movies\" releases from MGM(double sided disc) and in my oppinion the best film here out of the two is the 1959 production of Invisible Invaders,starring John Carradine.However this film has got to hold some kind of record for killing off it's name star within the first three minutes of the picture! For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr.Noymann in a radiation accident.After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr.Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world.He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him.Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence.Dr.Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead.The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die.Earth one,aliens nothing.Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie.Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is.It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster.Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.Journey puts the \"bad\" into the B-movie.It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn.Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location.The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them.They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested.Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet.They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way.Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship.A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave.Outside is waiting one of the captain's \"mirage\" women and for some reason he takes her aboard.All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the \"mirage\" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day \"Journey to the 7th Planet\"plays.Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration.John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however.Invaders is in B&W; (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format.Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp.Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate.Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind.I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!

Vanilla is my favorite, so when I got a chance to try this vanilla flavored coffee, I did it.It seems to me that every vanilla flavored coffee I've tried in the past did not really have a smooth vanilla flavor that I hoped for, and this one is no different. The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes \"burnt.\"As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it.

Even though I was early, they were able to get me into my room right away.I was on the 29th floor and had a great view of the city. The room was very clean and had nice amenities (ipod charger, conveniently located electrical plugs, books about SF, DVD player). Love the bliss products in the bathroom. As usual, for a Starwood property, the bed was soooooo comfortable. The location was great, very centrally located for shopping, dining and public transportation. The hotel definitely caters to a younger, hipper crowd than I, but I never felt out of place. I had a drink at the hotel bar and the bartender was friendly and made a great cocktail.I liked it better then some of the other W's I have stayed at and would definitely stay there again.

      "Corresponding review: One of the MOST anticipated Blu Ray release of all time is finally here.  We've all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention.  Why does it get our attention?  Because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil, backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters.  Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bring a movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the \"original\" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.  I encourage everyone to do what I did and buy these films and watch them for the first time, you will be amazed at all that HD has done for these films.  Amazon has an incredible price, highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This place doesn't have to try too hard to be ultra hip or cool. The fact that the hotel doesn't even have to put a sign on the building or the door will tell you that. With that being said, a stay at the Clift can transport you to a hip and trendy city lifestyle, which is exactly what I wanted for a weekend getaway from suburbia. The rooms are clean, light, and tastefully decorated in a very modern style; very comfy sleigh bed with superior down and cotton bedding. I'm pretty picky about my sheets, and I was tempted to buy these to take home with me. The hotel has the bedding custom made for them and new sets are available for sale. A stay at the Clift can be pricey. This is a trendy five-star hotel after all. However, packages can be found with good discounts for people not wanting regular chain-like accomodations and adventurous to try something different. I opted for a deluxe room at the Clift and was glad I did. There were three large windows in my outside facing corner room allowing lots of light and pleasant city sounds to filter in. The Clift's location is not ideal for sweeping views; but this was acceptable with me when selecting the hotel. A nice touch to the decor of the room were the mirrors and floor to ceiling curtains adorning the walls. No need for artwork that way, just the pleasant mix of colors, fabrics, glass, and contemporary furniture. Is the decor what I might select for my home? Probably not, but the change of scenery sure was fun for a evening. The room had candles and matches ready to go and the warm indirect lighting helped make this a contemporary romantic getaway. The CD player had excellent sound and the DVD player was a nice touch. Some might find the tv a joke as it's only a 19&quot; model, but then again, I wasn't shelling out big bucks for watching tv. The location of the Clift is excellent for the theatre/shopping crowd and getting a cab is not too difficult. The front desk staff and the doormen were very friendly and helpful. The only thing keeping this stay from being an excellent experience was the breakfast at the Asia De Cuba restaurant. The decor and the food are nice, but they must have been understaffed the morning I decided to go, although the restaurant was not even 25% full. Breakfast was included with my special package rate, so this is where I was going to dine no matter what, but I expected decent, if not excellent and courteous service at such a fine restaurant. I could barely get a refill on my iced tea. The table next to mine was getting very impatient and almost downright rude about the slow service. All in all, I would steer clear of breakfast, unless it's included in your rate. Reviews for lunch and dinner seem to be better...so maybe someday I'll check it out, but with so many other choices in the city, the Asia De Cuba left a bad impression on me and it will be some time before I return to eat there. Some people leaving reviews have complained about noise, smelling smoke in the hallways, and having no dresser in the room, but I did not encounter any problem with these. I found the closet adequate for my luggage and unpacking of my necessary items so as to reduce wrinkling. As for noise, this is the CITY, not a country getaway, so I anticipated I'd hear some noise at some point in my stay, but honestly, I was never disrupted by noise in any way. I definitely rate the hotel very high in terms of a nice stay and felt I had a good value for my money. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I would not surprise to see them if I am not in a Japanese restaurant. Have waited for more than ten minutes and we had to raise our hand to notify the wait or and waitress that we were ready to order. We wanted to order the tasting menu, but was only told that it has to be booked a day in advance. So we settled for the $50 sashimi and sushi combo. The sashimi were nice, however my friend and I have observed the senior waiter let our sushi dish sitting on the top of counter for more than five minutes until there was no other dishes on the counter even they were brought out later than the our sushi dish. Why this is a big deal? Any sushi chef will enforce you to eat the sushi just made within a minute or two once it was made. This was quite disappointed and we are unsure the reason why the waiter made such decision. For the price we paid for the meal, around 300 Canadian dollars, we would better off with other upscale Japanese cuisine in the town. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We stayed here over Labor Day for 3 nights in a deluxe queen room. The room wasn't huge but it was a good size for two people. The bed was a true queen size and very comfortable with nice bedding. The room was nicely decorated and had a medium size TV, a desk, 2 chairs, cd player with cd's, AC, and a small fridge. The room was very clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning everyday. We had our bedding and towels changed every day. Although you have the option of not having them changed everyday to save water (good idea!). They also have a turn down service and left yummy chocolates on our pillows. The bathroom has a small hairdryer and Aveda products. Our room didn't have much of a view but we didn't mind since we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The hotel staff was very friendly. We were allowed to check in early and they asked if we needed help with restaurant reservations or general information about SF. There are free maps and guidebooks in all tourist spots so no need to bring your own. The hotel also has free computer access and a room where you could either work or read. The restuarant is very small and didn't have a chance to eat there. I think there are less than 20 seats. So it's wise to make a reservation or arrive early. There was also a bar/lounge area. The elevator is fairly small and if there were other people waiting, we just took the stairs. The hotel is within walking distance from the BART station. Exit Powell and it's about ten minute walk. The fridge is fully stocked but like any other hotel, the prices are high. There is a Walgreens down the street from the hotel where you can stock up on water or snack. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. Some a bit expensive but it's expected as SF as a whole is expensive. There are 3 Starbucks coffee houses near the hotel. If you like to shop, the hotel is minutes from Union Square and is also within walking distance to Chinatown. We actually walked from Pier 39 and it didn't seem far at all. SF has reliable and efficient transportation that is fairly priced in case you don't want to walk. I don't recall the exact price for parking since we flew but most of the hotels charge from $40 and up per night. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel. I highly recommend it and would stay here again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is my review for the New Trent Airbender 1.0 (NT38B).  I received this product and right off the bat I liked the packaging and the helpful instructions inside.  After having a chance to use It I was blown away.  It has sturdy construction and the battery life on the keyboard is very nice.  Not to mention rechargeable.  In other products you would have to lug around a keyboard and a case if you wanted something to protect your device and be able to be productive.  With this case it is all in one.  I liked the adjustability of the orientations that the pad could be put in it helps when doing different tasks.  I also liked the adjustability because there are sometimes depending on light and other factors when you need the Ipad to be at a certain angle.I have in the past had a case that did well with protecting it, and had a stand but it was two pieces and the stand was not very adjustable.  I would have to use other small items to prop the screen up further.I also believe this case provides decent protection to my device, although I am not sure I would want to drop it in this case as I think the case would not fully protect it.  But for every day usage I believe that it would hold up.I like the look and feel of the keyboard the layout is nice and they keys are great to type with.  I do not do a lot of writing on my pad but with some of the new apps coming out for the pad I just may start on my memoirs.  Syncing the pad to the keyboard was quick and easy and worked right out of the box with no charging required.  The response of the keys are very fast and I do not even notice the time it take over Bluetooth.New Trent also took care to make sure all of the proper ports were left unobstructed. I even find that most aftermarket cables for the ipad function with this case on.  The one thing I would like to see, and I am not sure if it is even possible would be a all in one usb cord.  One that could connect to a apple charger and into a single usb port instead of having to find two separate ports to use for charging and using the pad.  I do admit that this would be a rare thing but I think it would put this product over the top.I think this product would be great for business men and women, a suitable replacement for a cumbersome laptop or when you just need something small for traveling.  It is a little hard to fit most modern day laptops on a seatback not to mention they are very heavy.  With this product you get a mini laptop just for the cost of your already purchased ipad and less than $40.00.I have enjoyed all the New Trent products to date and I can not wait to see what the good people in this company come up with next.

      "Corresponding review: The views are indeed spectacular within the rooms and I really liked my stay here, especially the location (right in the middel of downtown, easy walking distance to Nob Hill, Coit Tower, North Beach restaurants &amp; bars). The hotel is on the upper floors of the building (I was on 43rd floor) and my room seemed very large for a non-suite (actually had a hallway); my friend's room wasn't quite as large but still roomy and big compared to most hotels I've stayed in. And although I'm not a very demanding traveler and don't need all the perks associated with some of the more decadent/full-service oriented types, the few times I needed help the excellent service came through. A fax I was expecting was ready for me within 5 minutes, and evey time I asked the concierge to check on my flight or make restaurant reservations it was done immediately. Allin all, the service was very polite and timely. The bathrooms in the room were large and contained everything you could possibly need - including a bath and separate shower. The bed was extremely comfortable - as was waking up to an almost 180 degree view of SF et environs every morning!! (I will have to bring my girlfriend here sometime).On the negative side, a few minor things. First, there are only 2 elevators which made for a couple minutes of waiting from time to time (usually not a problem). Also, the gym is very small and on the 4th floor with no windows which isn't ideal and not what I'm used to at other MO's (DC and NYC) which have much larger gyms with views and a pool (DC at least) - no pool here (unlike the Ritz and Four Seasons). And the hotel lobby is nice but pretty understated and small so don't expect a grand entrance - the location and views are what you pay for here. I will come back to this hotel, but as I'm a big exerciser I think that the Ritz and Four Season are also great choices if you want a larger gym and pool.

They could have added some more to the movie but it was alright anyway and it makes you want to watch the sequel. The movie did have some good fight scenes though. Overall it was pretty interesting to watch so if you are looking for a good action movie, this is a good one to see. However, warning, this is not for the faint of heart. There is much blood and gore.  But if you don't mind watching someone getting their head chopped off and then seeing the blood spill out of their lifeless body then by all means this is the movie for you. By the way all of the blood looks extremely fake and seems to be made the same way the blood was made for the comic book scenes. What a pity. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I wasn't really sure what to expect from this tea. I enjoy ginger but it's one of those flavors that can easily be overdone and become overpowering - fortunately that was not the case here.This tea has a very earthy aroma with ginger undertones and what I recognized as a bit of almost a wine scent. I found the aroma to be very complex and pleasant.If you like a bold tea, the flavor here will not disappoint. This tea has a strong earthy taste with a touch of ginger bite. Again, I was concerned that the ginger would be too much but it's just right in this tea. I found the tea to have a lingering earthy aftertaste as well.Overall I'm impressed with this tea. I enjoy earl grey, English breakfast and Irish breakfast teas and found this tea to be on a similar plane as those. I've made this tea both plain and with cream and sugar and it is delicious both ways. The strong, bold flavor may not be for everyone but I personally really enjoy it.

      "Corresponding question: What do you think about almond?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Anything that claims to be \"dark chocolate\" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  When I crave nuts, I go right for this canister, but when I crave chocolate, I look for something else.Also from the same company and recommended by me:Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12),Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Peanut, Honey Roasted Peanut & Cocktail Peanut, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 18),Emerald Nuts Glazed Walnuts, Original, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I, like Johnny Depp, would run home from school and watch Dark Shadows.  I loved it because it was unique.  Let's face it, TV in the 70's was terrible and Dark Shadows, even though they considered it a soap, was refreshing.  All the actors do an excellent job and the movie is hilarious!  The only way they could have pulled it off was making it a comedy and the only people who could pull that off are Burton and Depp.  I loved the music throughout the movie so much that I immediately bought the soundtrack.  My kids never saw Dark Shadows and they both loved this movie.  I don't think it would have worked if they had done a serious, soapy type movie.  It would have been just another Twilight.  Who needs another Twilight!  If you grew up in the 70's, you will love the way they poked fun of that time.  It was like going down memory lane.  One of my favorite scenes is with Alice Cooper.  I love Alice Cooper and he has a great sense of humor.  They also left it open for a second film.  I hope they do another one soon!  I highly recommend this movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I wrote a brief review over a month ago and people have hated it because I said the movie was going to big. Well the movie is big and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.First of all let me say that I have never read the Illiad. I have read the Odyessey and I enjoyed it a lot. From what I've been told of people the movie is not very acurate at all. However, I did enjoy it despite it's flaws in the story.I think by now everybody has heard the plot to the movie. Paris(Bloom) runs off with Helen(Kruger) because they are in love and she no longer wants to stay with her husband Menelaus the King of Sparta. Agnaemenon the head King of Greece looks at this as a chance to strike against the one kingdom that can face up to him in Troy.War is set and the Greeks must get the greatest warrior to fight for them. They get Achilles(Pitt)to fight for them. Agnaemenon is weary of this because Achilles doesn't worship him like the rest do, but he knows he needs him to win. They then sail off to Troy to get Helen and to conquer them.The city of Troy is not scared. King Priam(O'Toole) is not worried at all because of the high walls around his city, the sun god Apollo, and most of all because of his son Hector(Bana). The stage for the epic war is set and the battle is on.First of all let me say that I loved Brad Pitt in the movie. A lot of the critics have hammered him saying he didn't display the vainess and godlike qualities that Achillies displayed in the book. They must not have watched the same movie as I did. This was the most cocky and arrogant character Pitt has played to date. His vanity is incredible in the film. He also bulked up real big. He put on over 20lbs and he's cut to the bone.Eric Bana was great at Hector. Like Pitt he really bulked up as well. He does the best acting job in the film. He displays Hectors emotions perfectly. When he's going to fight Achillies he really does look like he knows he's the lamb going to the slaughter. His acting is superb and his performance is just awesome. He won't win an acadamey award, but you will enjoy it.Hector and Achillies are the two main characters in the film. The whole movie really does focus on the battle between the two of them and how much there respective people await on them.The sets in the movie are fantastic. They did a great job building the city of Troy. Everything looks authentic to the time period. It's about the only thing that is accurate to it's time.Like I said the movie is not accurate to Homers poem at all. It is however a great action film. If you look past those flaws and don't spend your time ripping the movie for it's flaws you really wil enjoy a well made action film. So sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and not what it should have been. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: If I had to sum up my sentiment for this film, it would have to be: \"it could have been so much better\".For starters, the characters are all cliched and instantly forgettable. Links to the previous films are extremely tenuous, and generally very lazy (in earlier films incubation of the alien inside humans took a day or two, here it only takes 5 minutes). This film should have been so much darker, more brutal, in line with the comic books. Instead they sold out rather, by trying to appeal to the masses.That said there is one redeeming feature of this film - the fight scenes between the alien and the predator. They are well executed, and genuinely exciting. Shame there is'nt more of them. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: It's too bad so many feel this first season wasn't funny compared to what is being put out now. This first season's episodes were a different sort of humor that didn't rely entirely on overblown/outlandish plots and cheap laughs. Much of the humor in these episodes is subtler and perhaps not sledgehammer enough for some people's tastes. Watching one of Groening's pre-Simpson's bunnies gnawing on Homer's arm while he rolls around on the grass is pretty funny if you can see the irony in it. The entire first season is full of inferred chuckles that some people might not get. That's too bad!The artwork is much more amateurish but that is pretty funny too and I have no doubt the crew must have laughed themselves silly when putting these episodes together. Personally I would much rather have this collection than anything labeled as The Simpsons in the last few years. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

We chose the medium spicy (which is a line of sriracha sauce). The next level was jalapeno peppers and the most spicest is the cabanara peppers.  The seating is minimal so I can imagine this place being packed on the week days for lunch.  In total, there are probably 15 seats?As for the kalbi beef, the texture is soft and that is a plus.  The bread was toasted just right.  Steamed Bao was good as well.  The steamed Bao is worth trying because the Bao is a different type of bread.  To choose between kalbi or braised beef, I am leaning towards kalbi.   For a filling meal though, the regular banh mi is suggested.Over all, good place and I will come back again if I am in the area.

      "Corresponding review: After seeing the previews for Game of Thrones on HBO in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, I said to myself, \"Here we go again with another Ken Follett-esquePillars of the Earthkinda show.\" Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR.Game of Thrones is right up my alley. Indeed it has the sword fights and debauchery that I mentioned a second ago, but I was under the impression that this was to be a depiction of some real world that existed a long long time ago. No...not at all the case. In the opening moments of the show we are introduced to a place that clearly has some \"Otherly\" world creatures in it. So after a little checking I see that the story is based on the fantasy book series by George R. R. Martin called A Song of Ice and Fire. The book series is highly rated here at Amazon with over 1000 reviews for the first installment called...you guessed it...Game of Thrones.The show is excellent. The HBO crew has created magic with Game of Thrones. It's a fantastic drama aimed towards an adult audience. It's must see TV for fans of the fantasy genre. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: First of all, The Book Thief is not a light read.  It took me a couple chapters to settle into the writing style.  The writing packs a punch and you really have to read the sentences fully to understand the beauty of them.  But this is a book that deserves your time and attention.  I have honestly never read anything like it.  First of all,  it is such a unique choice to have the story is narrated by Death.  His observations are at once detached and intimate.  He sees the overall picture, but is still affected by individuals.  It really drives home the devastation of World War II on both a large and a personal level.Secondly, the writing style itself is very unique.  Like I mentioned, it can take some getting used to, but there is real beauty in the words.  It shows how powerful words can be.  And again, it is not a book you can get through quickly, but you don't really want to either.Lastly, the characters are very very real.  They have faults.  They fight.  They falter.  But they also love and hope and dream.  There are some disturbing and some very devastating events in The Book Thief.  But ultimately, Liesel is a survivor and finds hope in even her darkest times.  She finds a way to pick up the pieces and live on, and so to do we as readers.As a warning though, the subject matter is pretty heavy.  I think it falls into that category of Young-Adult-But-Not-Really-Young-Adult.  The Book Thief does not shy away from the tough subjects of Nazi Germany, poverty, death, and war.  Some parts left me gutted, I won't lie.  But I am glad I read this book. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I saw &quot;A.I. Artificial Inteligence&quot; in June when it first came out and I walked out of the theatre thinking that I had just seen a masterpiece of modern day cinema. I also thought it was going to take a lot to beat this film for best of the year in my opinion, and now it is almost the end of September and I have not seen a single film so far this year that has been better. I have seen the film twice and I actually got more out of it the second time I saw it. This is definitely a film you have to see more than once just so you can fully realize the scope of the film and all the ideas that it brings up about our future and our society. I felt so mnany emotions while watching this film that it is hard to list them all. I felt sadened, exhilarated,  touched and frustrated all at once. The film is very unsettling to watch and it is a film that can not be easily forgotten. That is what I admired most about&quot;A.I.&quot;. It makes you feel real emotions for the characters, especailly David, played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, and Gigalo Joe, played by Jude Law who really is remarkable and perfectly cast as this character and it isn't afraid to make you feel disturbed because it is supposed to. It is supposed to put an imprint in your mind so you don't forget. I strongly admired Steven Spielberg's direction on this film. He is one of the best, if not the best, directors in the business today and he really made it seem as if Stanley Kuybrick was with him the whole time he shot this because I would say about ninety percent of this film seems like it was done by Stanley himself. The look and feel of the film are very dark for a usual Spielberg film, but it wasn't supposed to be a regular Spielberg film, it was supposed to a Stanley Kubrick/Steven Spielberg film and that is exactly what it turned out to be and it is pure brilliance. I think &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; is, so far, the year's best film and quite possibly one of the best I have ever seen and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great filmmaking.

      "Corresponding review: First, this is a household that VERY rarely drinks soda of any type due to health concerns and a deliberate decision to eradicate soda from our diets. Having said that, there are times when you really would like a soda. The Switch soda seems to fit the bill as a soda alternative...no sugar, no preservatives and no artificial sweeters - just carbonated fruit juice. So far so good. The taste is pretty good and quite comprable to \"unhealthy\" sodas - to the point that my other half didn't think it was healthy at all...he liked the flavor very well.The only reason ths didn't get a full five stars is the size is relatively small...something I personally didn't mind because I actually like the size and shape a LOT but spouse didn't...he felt it was just far too small...and the price. AT roughly $1 per can, this is considerably higher priced than a regular soda - however, in keeping with other healthy alternatives.Pro's -Good taste (can't tell this is healthy) that isn't \"over the top\"Nice level of carbonation - just rightHealthy alternative to a standard sodaCon's -PriceDebates -Size - 1 liked size other didn't like size (wanted larger size)Bottom line...I would probably purchase this if the price was lower but being a non-soda drinker would be unlikely to add this to my shopping list at this price. I probably would buy it via a vending machine when out and about and wanting an alternative to plain bottled water or soda (which I dont drink). ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I'm not going to pretend to be a coffee connoisseur, but I am a caffeine-addict as well as a coffee shop lover. Cute cafés are my jam! Jimmy's Coffee was a very average experience, however.Jimmy's uses the unsweetened almond milk from Silk, which is horrible because the unsweetened version tastes incredibly salty, and this definitely transferred to the taste of my almond milk latte. They use a rather acidic strain of coffee beans (re: sour), and the double shot macchiato was hard to swallow. Also, no latte art. Whaaaaat? The barista used some hand motions that made it LOOK like she was doing latte art, but in reality it looked like a white, unidentifiable blob in the middle of my tiny cup of coffee.There are three floors, yet there is zero place to sit down. The third floor has a conference-room style table, the second floor with a hodgepodge assortment of furniture, and the first floor has a severe lack of chairs. Good luck trying to enjoy your coffee inside!Jimmy's Coffee is an alright café, and I may drop by to try their other items. However I won't make a special trip for Jimmy's because there are better shops in my neighborhood, thanks. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How do you rate the flavor?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I am reviewing this product for Amazon, I received it as a gift for that purpose. After examining the ingredients list I noticed this has an awful lot of sugar, the first ingredient is Water, then Cane Sugar, do not let that make you think of wow that is good sugar. Sugar is sugar. Yes sugar is sugar but it tastes good and yes it has calories but how many really? there are 80 cals per serving in this bottle. This product used real sugar and yes it is over processed but it tastes good. It aids in the flavor of this drink.As I opened this chilled drink I was mindful of the aroma. Grapefruit, that is what it was screaming to me but there was a more complex scent, passion fruit maybe? Yes indeed it is flavored with passion fruit and very nicely, I am drinking the second half of the bottle right now and I can tell you I love it.I just cannot seem to wrap my mind around the fact it has so much sugar, with that much sugar anything would taste this good. Ok so I am testing it, (right now as I write this review) it says it has 19 grams of sugar per serving.Wait a minute, I just checked the label again, it is very hard to see letters since they are so small and the ingredients list is written in an obscure font and made a little hazy, to hide the fact is has 19 grams of sugar per serving? Hmm what is this, it is not one serving per bottle, it is 1.5 servings per bottle,why do they give you 1.5 servings are you going to share it with 1.5 people? So that means this entire bottle (only 11.5 oz.) has not just 19 grams of sugar but a hefty 27 plus grams of sugar.Do you know what 27 grams of sugar equates to in teaspoons?Now this is not a scientific experiment by any means but I just used a very reliable scale and found that it takes 7 tsp. of sugar to come up with 27 grams of sugar and that is what is in this drink I just consumed. Wait let me reduce the stars on my rating to 3.....When I need a magnifying glass to see the ingredients list that makes me pause, and ask why? I guess we now know why, I never use more that about 3 tsp. sugar in any form per day I just used up my next few days.Let's see a cola drink has less sugar than this drink, why would I drink this, for a sugar high? not likely. I would give more comparisons but I do not used many processed foods to look on the labels.Diabetics stay away, this is not for you, in fact it is not for me, is this your kind of drink that you would want or better still, give to your children?The only thing right now that has anything going for it is the taste, so if you don't mind the 27 grams of sugar per bottle then be my guest you will enjoy it, it has a wonderful bright light flavor. Know that it also has a lot of pulp going through it, and according to the label it has natural flavors and not real fruit, so what is that stuff floating in it, it is not real fruit hmmm...The aftertaste is not so bad, I guess you can just cover that up by drinking another bottle of this sugar water.I am sorry folks but this review went down very fast, I am sorry I cannot recommend this drink due to it's over use of sweetener. In fact I will not be finishing it myself. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: More like a 3.5, not 4.  But I will be nice since it's fairly new. So.  I was really prepared to love this resto.. I remember seeing raving reviews from a few foodie friends that went and getting hyped about trying the items on their menu.  However, I was ill-prepared in doing my homework for which dishes to order, which led to a couple bad choices on our part.Small Plates-TABLE SIDE WELLINGTON COUNTY BEEF TARTARI mean.. I like it, I just don't love it.  It had a tangy kick similar to the horse tartar I had at Black Hoof, but the seasoning wasn't all there and while I enjoyed the first few bites, I kind of got bored half way through.  The bread it came with complemented the dish well, but.. it was alright.  -FRENCH ONION SOUPI didn't pick this one; but we both thought this was a bit too salty... Duncan House's French onion soup blew this one out of the waters and I honestly couldn't have any more after two spoonfuls.  Too much salt, the cheese couldn't even be the saving grace.. nor could the lovely bread.  Large PlatesHUNTER'S STEW - Rabbit, pheasant sausage, beef cheek, whole mustard sauceGod I loved the pheasant sausage.  I thought it would taste like chicken.. but nope.  It The mustard sauce complimented the protein so perfectly, and while I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie medley in the stew, the sausage made the dish for me.  Rabbit meat also had a more distinctive taste than the last time I had it at Luma.Recommended!DRUNKEN TUNA - Seared ahi, red pepper pesto, pomme purée, rocket salad, sherry vinaigretteThe tuna was done medium rare - on the rarer side.  I thought it was really flavourful but the birthday boy I came with thought it was a little salty.  To each their own but this was recommended to us by the waiter and I really liked the red pepper pesto on the side as well when I dipped the tuna in it :)  YUM.DessertMACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHESHonestly just ordered this one so I could have a birthday message for the birthday boy.  It was really nice that when I included my request in my reservation in Open Table, they remembered and spelt on a message with chocolate & added a candle and everything!  I hear they give complimentary desserts to birthday guests anyway.  The dessert itself.. well, I had better macarons for sure.  The ice cream and sorbet were delish (raspberry sorbet, bailey's ice cream, and vanilla) - but the macarons were a little disappointing.Overall, the ambiance was fantastic and makes the resto very fit for a special occasion.  Especially around the holiday times when the Christmas Market is going on and everything in the distillery is absolutely beautiful. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I usually choose my yearly 100th book to read based on it meaning something to me, but this year I couldn't come up with anything, but then I remembered this book. I have a few friends, one in particular (hi, &lt;a href=\"[...]\">Lisa&lt;/a>!), who have been hounding me to read these for a while. Honestly, it's YA, it's somewhat SciFi and the description just didn't seem to grab me. But I decided that my 100th book would be a nod to my friends and family that are always telling me \"Oh, you HAVE to read this book\". So, then...I got about 5% into the book and was completely disgusted. I think I may have called Lisa a very bad name. You see, I could NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. It was darn well nearly physically attached to my hand. I lost sleep, I gasped in certain places, I yelled \"no!\" a few times, I was, in short, insane for the day it took me to read this one.The author completely sucks you into this world of the future. Of kids dying as sacrifices to the capital. Of a love triangle. Of family bonds. Of humanity. There is so much going on in the book that it seems like it would be confusing, but in reality, you are so caught up in the entire story that it doesn't matter. It's all-encompassing. It's all-consuming. It's, as Lisa told me, un-put-down-able.There are scenes that rip your heart out in this book. I had to remind myself when I was done that it was YA (Young Adult) because I enjoyed it immensely. Most YA material I can take or leave but this had me hitting the \"buy\" button for the next in the series within 2 minutes of finishing it.This one makes my must-read list for 2010. I also do not know how to recommend this for, I simply cannot come up with anyone that might not enjoy it.

      "Corresponding review: I am going to start my little review with the one aspect of this gem of a book that I disliked: it becomes apparent towards the end that it is \"part one\" of a series. This might not be a negative for some folks, but I am rather tired of the trend that YA books MUST be serialized. One of these days I would really like a great, thrilling, stand-alone YA story.Okay, enough of that grumpiness.So, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. I liked it a lot. It has a stunningly lovely cover. I liked the integration of creepy old photos with the story, and I thought the tale was great fun, spooky and imaginative. The action bogged down a bit in the middle of the book, but there is very welcome and scary jolt around chapter nine that sets the story apace again. Most of the characters are interesting and curious(peculiar!), although the protagonist, Jacob, is not really one of them. The conceit of a hidden time-loop world, extraordinary and ageless children, shape-shifting bird/governesses, and ghastly wights and horrid hallowgasts make for a thrilling adventure. As noted, the story slogs a bit in the middle, but there are enough twists, chases, and creepy revelations towards the end to save it. I will seek out the next installment because I want to find out how the kids and the Bird fare in their quest, but gosh I sure do wish that it had simply been a bigger book with tighter storytelling. That said--I highly recommend Miss Peregrine and her fabulous wards as a great read and even better leaping off point for a day's musings. It's a story that stays with you even after you shut the book.Be sure to check out the author's website---- for some great videos and news about his upcoming photo collection book called Talking Pictures.

      "Human answer: The acting is well done\n",
      "Corresponding question: How about the character of the actors in the movie?\n",
      "Corresponding review: First of all, Prometheus is a prequel. It takes place, many years, before the events of Alien.There are Space Jockeys. What they are and what their intentions seem to be, are partially, explained. By the end of the film, there are still many questions to be answered. Its obvious there is more to be told and revealed in another film.If you're hoping to see facehuggers, chestbursters and xenomorphs (full-grown Aliens), well, you do get to see some creatures, but none of them are recognizable. In fact, these creatures seem to be early versions of the Aliens or the original creatures that the Aliens came from. These creatures have elements of the Aliens and are no doubt, related.I don't want to give away the plot, but know the planet and the Jockeys are not the same that are seen in Alien. This is a different planet and these Jockey ships aren't carrying eggs.Now, people who have seen the film say it lacks character development and the film is overall, disappointing. I agree that the film is a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action, but the action scenes, including a self-surgical procedure scene, are intense.The cinematography and visual effects are stunning, as well as designs and sets. The production is just fantastic.The acting is well done, especially, by Michael Fassbender as \"David\", Noomi Rapace as \"Elizabeth Shaw\", and Charlie Theron as \"Meredith Vickers\".The story/script is kind of frustrating to follow, due to many questions it proposes, but I thought the pacing was ok. It felt like it was quicker than Alien's and that has to do with less character development scenes (which honestly, Alien was rather light on character development).I understand that people were disappointed that this was not \"Alien\" and I agree, to an extent, but that was  not the intention of Ridley and the writers, to make another Alien film. It's a prequel story that takes place at a much earlier time. There are elements of the franchise, absolutely, but this is it's own prequel story.For what is, I enjoyed it and can't wait to see the answers in the sequel.If you read other reviews that are mixed or negative, I just say don't expect \"Alien\". Expect an original prequel story that only asks many questions that will need answers. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I was wrong.Technically, both the video and audio quality are excellent.  In terms of value, the extra features, most especially the commentary by some of the military personnel who were present, are alone worth the price of admission.  As far as the movie itself, this is a great one.  The story is compelling, especially since it's based on an actual event.  The directing is top-notch.  The acting is excellent and wholly believable.

      "Corresponding review: Visited the Holiday Inn Express 4/24 - 4/28. Overall, we were happy with the hotel. The location was perfect for us - close to the wharf and local transit. The hotel itself is very nice looking with a modern decor. Our room, single king bed, was more than adequate. Maid service was good. The breakfast was decent for a hotel complimentery breakfast. There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4.There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little &quot;extras&quot;. I thought it would have been nice to have coffee/tea service in the lobby area throughout the day, not just until 9:30 am - we've had this at other Holiday Inn Express hotels and basic type hotels such as Quality Inns, etc. Some aspects of service could have been a little better as well. I wanted to have a tea in my room early one evening. I had forgot to take a milk back up to the room in the morning - tea with powdered whitener just isn't that great. I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their &quot;house man&quot; was not on duty. While I was waiting at the front desk an older man approached and indicated that they had just returned from their day out and their room hadn't been cleaned. The gentleman at the front desk indicated that he &quot;couldn't understand how that could happen, it had never happened before&quot;. He asked the guest if he was sure he didn't leave his Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The guest replied he was sure he hadn't. The front desk clerk then proceeded to tell the gentlemant there was nothing he could for him as the cleaning staff were gone for the day and again, the house man was not in. The front desk clerk didn't offer anything to the guest for the inconvenience - he just restated he couldn't understand how that could happen. To me, surely someone could have gone up and emptied the garbages and at least gave them clean towels? Also, don't forget that parking is very expensive, as is pretty standard with wharf area hotels. We didn't have a vechicle but noticed that the valet parking was over $40 per night. If we returned to SF, we wouldn't have any hesitation staying at this hotel again as any issues we had were really quite minor. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: &quot;You run like a boy.&quot; - Lucious tells Ivy, his future bride-to-be, she's a girly-man in, M. Night Shyamalan's crap-fest, &quot;The Village&quot;An abortion of a film, &quot;The Village&quot; is the ripoff movie of 2004 with &quot;Van Helsing&quot; right next to it. These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with &quot;Signs&quot;, & &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, with a complimentary helping of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). &quot;The Village&quot; is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local &quot;Pottery Barn&quot;.&quot;Covington Woods&quot; is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to &quot;creatures&quot; living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the &quot;creatures&quot; along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. &quot;The creatures&quot; have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of &quot;the creatures&quot;, is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.As I watched &quot;The Village&quot;, with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill &quot;the creatures&quot; herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from &quot;Signs&quot;. Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).&quot;The creature&quot; is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this &quot;creature&quot; chasing me.The so called &quot;gotcha&quot; surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.&quot;Time&quot; magazine was once quoted as saying that M. Night Shyamalan is the next Steven Spielberg. No way in Hell, buddy. No way. Not even with a Ford Focus full of clowns. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Well, first off I should say that I'm not new to tea.  I'm not sure I'd describe myself as a \"tea connoisseur\" but I'm pretty experienced with tea.  I've tried just about every type of tea out there (white, black, green, herbal, even puerh tea!), and I regularly make my own custom blends using loose leaf herbs and spices.  I'm a pretty big fan of tea, so I naturally jumped at the chance to get some nice chai tea.  I already have my own homemade chai recipes that involve simmering loose spices and adding in milk and sugar, and it's great, but I've always wanted to try some plain chai without the milk.So I got the Higgins and Burk Chai in the mail and decided to brew myself a cup to try out.  I steeped it a full 10 minutes because I steep all my tea for 10 minutes (I suspect a lot of people would find this too strong for their tastes, but that's how I like it).  My first impressions of this tea is that it's pretty weak for a chai style tea.  I felt like the strongest taste was the cloves, and it really could've used stronger notes of ginger and cinnamon.  Not to mention, the black tea portion of it tastes a bit not-so-good to me.  It's difficult to describe, but I'll explain it as best as I can.  I once bought a huge box of cheap crappy pekoe black tea and it tasted terrible.  It was just lacking in good flavor and only tasted of bitter tannins and blandness and nothing else.  This tea is not nearly as bad as that one was, but the black tea portion of it seems to have a bit of that taste to it.  I had my own Assam tea (before I used it all and ran out) and it seemed to taste much better than this - even plain with nothing else in it!  Of course, it could've been because of the source of my teas/spices (I get everything from the mountainroseherbs website); maybe the tea is better from there.  Anyway, the other spices in the tea hide it well enough so it's not a big deal.  I did decide to make my own homemade blend to see how it would turn out using the same ingredients (I used 2 parts black tea, 1/2 part cinnamon, 1/8 part cloves, 1/8 part cardamom, and 1/2 part ginger).  Then I did a side by side taste test using the exact same amount of sweetener.  The Higgins and Burke version is not terrible or anything, but I still think my version won by a small margin.Anyway, if you're a casual tea drinker, this tea will probably be fine for your tastes, and far more convenient than making your own loose-leaf blends.  In addition, if you are the sort who prefers a less spicy chai then this tea would be great!  In the course of further usage, I also discovered that the Higgins and Burke tastes better as an iced tea.  Go figure!  Well, my overall opinion of the Higgins and Burke Black Chai is that it is a decent choice for anyone who wants a mild pleasant chai in a convenient tea-bag option, but I think I'm going to personally stick to my own homemade formula because I love making loose leaf tea blends!

It was without doubt one of the finest hotels we've ever stayed at - it is located in a beautiful neighbourhood surrounded by amazing houses that would put Beverley Hills to shame !The hotel itself is a boutique style and this works wonderfully in it's favour - far too many chain hotels treat you as a number. At the Drisco the personal touch offered by the staff made us feel at home from the moment we walked through the door.A special mention must go to Bob, the concierge and general San Francisco expert, who greeted us like long lost friends and gave us a guided tour of the amenities of the hotel when we arrived. He was excellent in recommending restaurants, and also suggested suitable walks of the local area to ensure we got the very best out of our stay.The rooms were very nice and were very luxuriously furnished (we wanted to bring the extremely comfortable bed back to the UK with us!!)Location wise you are about a 10 minute walk from Fillmore street where there are lots of nice places to eat and drink as well as some unusual but interesting shops. A little bit further along is the California street cable car stop where you can easily get around the city (it's also cool hanging onto the side of the cable cars and surfing the streets of San Francisco !!)Back to the hotel....

      "Corresponding review: For reasons of space, I shall pass over the routine recital, now given in hundreds of the reviews, of most of the points in Dawkins' book The God Delusion, and concentrate my review on one point only, which he deals with on pages 339,340.  His position is, unambiguously, that there cannot be any such thing as `human' ethics or morality, and he tells us why:  there is no real, meaningful distinction between a human being and a brute beast.  I am astonished that this passage is not more frequently commented on.Dawkins simply ignores the critical issue of human rationality. Flying in the face of all the evidence, he assumes (I insist, he assumes, he does not prove) that Homo sapiens, absolutely like every other form of life on earth, is simply a bundle of cells.  He says (p. 340):  \"The evolutionary point is very simple.  The humanness (italicised) of an embryo's cells cannot confer upon it any absolutely discontinuous moral status.\"  I must underline what Dawkins is saying.  He is not saying that man is `like' the brute beast in some ways ('Intelligent Design' authors like Antony Latham, Alister McGrath and Michael Behe who attack Dawkins' atheism have no difficulty in accepting common descent, shared cellular similarities with the rest of creation, in varying degrees).  He is saying that man is `no more than' a brute beast in any way, is no more than a collection of cells.Dawkins explicitly rejects the idea that any moral consideration can apply to humans simply as humans. He rejects the idea that there is anything that clearly separates human beings from non-human animals. This follows from his view that limits everything to pure Darwinian evolution of matter from matter.  He believes in the evolution of the non-human animal into the human animal, body, mind, 'spirit', 'soul', religion, science, and all.  He tells us (p. 339):  \"Notice now that 'pro-life' doesn't exactly mean pro-life ('life' is italicised) at all.  It means pro-human('human' is italicised)-life.\"  Of necessity this must mean that he views all merely brute animal life as equal with human life.Notice the monstrous conclusion that follows from this.  It destroys any possibility that Dawkins' version of Darwinism can be right.  \"The granting of uniquely special rights to cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' is hard to reconcile with the fact of evolution\" (p. 339).  I repeat this:  \"The granting of uniquely special rights to cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' is hard to reconcile with the fact of evolution.\"  I conclude:  It is not only hard, it is impossible (which is what Dawkins clearly means us to understand).  And therefore, for me, on the grounds of the evidence provided to any observer (even a Darwinian observer) that Homo sapiens and the brute beast are not the same, Dawkins' 'fact of evolution' must be abandoned.  I see no alternative to this.  Dawkins is utterly indefensible here.  But his arrogance blinds him to the absurdity of his own position, for he goes on immediately:  \"Admittedly, this [irreconcilability between the pro-lifers and the Darwinists] will not worry those many anti-abortionists who don't understand that evolution is a fact!\" (Dawkins is responsible for the exclamation mark.)  Dawkins has just proved, to my satisfaction, that 'the fact of evolution' cannot be a 'fact' because of the manifest monstrousness of the conclusion that he sees as necessarily following from his position.  Surely the idea that a human being is fully and exhaustively defined by its having \"cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' \", to use Dawkins' own words, in exactly the same way as any other living organism is fully and exhaustively defined by its having cells of its own species, is an intolerable assumption that, I repeat, will not stand one moment's observation of the world about us.  This Dawkinsism must be exploded for the absurdity that it is.Dawkins takes as proved (but doesn't prove) the existence of 'intermediate species' (Dawkins' words) between man and any brute beast you care to name.  So Dawkins asks the question: \"Would these [intermediate] creatures 'count as human' or not?\" Dawkins replies (p. 340) that only 'absolutists' \"must answer the question, in order to apply the moral principle of granting humans unique and special status because they are human\" (Dawkins puts the last four words in italics (p.340). Dawkins scorns this 'absolutist' position.  He says:  \"To a consequentialist like me, the question doesn't deserve an answer, for nothing turns on it.\"  Can Dawkins be really aware of what he is saying?  He tells us that it doesn't matter if we are humans or brute beasts, \"for nothing turns on it\".  Once again, this must be exploded for the absurdity that it is.He goes on (p.340): \"Even if a clear answer [as to whether a living being is a human or a brute beast] might be attempted for Australopithecus, the gradual continuity that is an inescapable feature of biological evolution [another glib assumption of Dawkins that he doesn't prove] tells us that there must be some intermediate who would lie sufficiently close to the 'borderline' to blur the moral principle and destroy its absoluteness. A better way to say this is that there are no natural borderlines in evolution. The illusion of a borderline is created by the fact that the evolutionary intermediates happen to be extinct. Of course, it could be argued that humans are more capable of, for example, suffering than other species. This could well be true, and we might legitimately give humans special status by virtue of it.\" (Understand what Dawkins is saying: the only reason that he can find for granting human beings any 'unique and special status' 'because they are human', is that the human may be more conscious of suffering than the brute beast.  Dawkins continues: \"But evolutionary continuity shows that there is no absolute (in italics) distinction.\"  Yet again, an absurdity to be addressed and condemned.Understand again what Dawkins is saying: There is no absolute distinction between human beings and brute beasts - or any other of the now-lost 'intermediate species'.  He goes on: \"Absolutist moral discrimination is devastatingly undermined by the fact of evolution.  [I riposte:  Exactly the opposite statement is true:  'The fact of evolution is devastatingly undermined by absolutist moral discrimination'.] An uneasy awareness of this fact might, indeed, underlie one of the main motives creationists have for opposing evolution: they fear what they believe to be its moral consequences. They are wrong to do so\" [Are they really? Am I then free to judge Dawkins the same way that I judge a brute beast? Does Dawkins accept that it is acceptable for a human being to be a carnivore?  Where do I draw the line in my choice of meat meals?]  \"but\", Dawkins goes on, \"in any case, it is surely very odd to think that a truth about the real world can be reversed by considerations of what would be morally desirable.\" Really?  This is intolerable reasoning.  It is not odd, it is essential, that what is 'morally desirable' must rule the world.  Law and order would collapse otherwise. Murder and lying and stealing and adultery are 'truths about the real world'. Morality is a truth of the real world. Without 'morally desirable' judgments, which Dawkins' Darwinism considers to be impossible, the quiet world of scholarship (and even scholarship is impossible as a strict Darwinian evolution from matter) that Dawkins inhabits would collapse into sheer barbarism, '(human) nature red in tooth and claw'. Dawkins' philosophical ramblings here are simply derisory.Ruse and Wilson, `respected giants in this field' of moral philosophy and science, find it \"easy to conceive of an alien intelligent species evolving rules its members consider highly moral but which are repugnant to human beings, such as cannibalism, incest, the love of darkness and decay, parricide and the eating of faeces ... \" (quoted in Latham's The Naked Emperor, pp, 154,155). Dawkins' reasoning above forces him to accept such a scenario as unobjectionable morally for us humans now. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The story of Ralph and Vanellope is sweet, reflecting the film's theme of friendship and self-discovery, but not too sweet, with credible character interactions.The old-fashioned games at arcade would make some adult viewers feel nostalgic, but the film does not rely on the idea to entertain us.

      "Corresponding question: How is the product?\n",
      "Corresponding review: WHO NEEDS IT?This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt; ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the writing style of story on this book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Donna Tartt has written a novel, a tome, that is as much about love, life and beauty as it is about nihilism, catastrophe and death.Written in the first person, 12 year-old Theo Decker's life is divided into before and after his mother's death.  Together, he and his mother are on their way to his school for a conference to discuss some unknown behavioral issues of Theo's.  On the way, due to bad weather, they stop at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  While there, some terrorists bomb the museum and his mother is killed.  As Theo searches for his mother, he meets a dying man named Welty who gives him an antique ring that he asks him to deliver to someone named Hobart.  He also meets a girl named Pippa to whom he forms a lifelong obsessive attachment and love.  When Theo finds out that his mother has died, he is devastated.  His father has walked out on them over a year ago and is a mean drunk and a gambler.Most importantly, when Theo leaves the museum, he walks out with a small masterpiece under his arm.  It is entitled The Goldfinch and the artist is Fabritius.  Painted in the latter 1600's it is one of only a few of Fabritius's work that has survived.  For Theo, it represents something stable, a way of holding on to something that was meaningful to his mother, and thus a part of her.The novel takes us though Theo's life into his twenties.  We first go with him to the Barbour family that takes him in after his mother's death.  Their son Andy has been a friend of Theo's for a few years.  Both are outcasts in their middle school and are prone to being the brunt of bullies.  The Barbours are very rich and enjoy Theo but are not demonstrative.  Mr. Barbour has recently been released from a psychiatric hospital and his behavior is somewhat odd.  The Barbour children, other than Andy, resent Theo's presence.  Despite this, however, Theo likes it there and would like to remain with them.  His only remaining relatives are his father, whereabouts unknown, and his paternal grandparents, unloving and not wanting to take Theo in.Out of the blue, Theo's father appears with his girlfriend Xandra and they take Theo with them to Las Vegas.  There, Theo meets Boris who becomes a lifelong friend.  Together, they get into hardcore drugs, illegal activities and drinking.  Theo's father is living well due to a good gambling streak but things start to fall apart and it is not long before Theo is back in New York City where he finds shelter with Hobart (Hobie) in his antique store.  Theo's life is a mess.  He is heavily into drugs and constantly blames himself for his mother's death.All the while, Theo holds on to the Goldfinch like a talisman.  He keeps it wrapped up most of the time but unwraps it now and then to look at it and revel in its beauty and personal meaning.  He knows he should return it but he keeps putting that off.The novel is longer than it needs to be.  Ms. Tartt, who can write beautifully, often goes into tangents and philosophical discussions that are unnecessary.  Characters come and go who are like red herrings.  Despite this, the book has its brilliant aspects.  The characterization of Theo is superb and his despair and longing is brought out in depth.  The symptoms of his post-traumatic stress disorder are clinically accurate.  I enjoyed this book immensely but I wish that the editing had been tighter. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The Sir Francis Drake is a great hotel if you''re looking for a place that has the elegance of days gone by but is up-to-date with the latest amenities. As an early 20th century hotel that has been extensively renovated, even the ''deluxe'' rooms are small by modern standards, which is okay as long as you''re prepared for it. Amenities in the rooms such as free Internet and a charging station for your phone, tablet, etc. were nice. We stayed with our infant and the room was pretty cramped for the three of us. The bathroom was *very* tiny and the floor space in the room once a crib was in there was pretty limited. The bed was not very comfortable and the foam pillows we requested #instead of the normal down pillows# were the worst of any hotel I''ve ever stayed in. The decor was nice but, when it comes right down to it, comfort trumps looks and this was definitely the weak point of the room. However, we did have a corner room on the 14th floor, though, which provided great views of San Francisco! The hotel restaurant, Scala''s, was good and the lobby bar was very lively during the week and throughout the weekend. The hotel''s location is great for shopping and the famous San Fran cable cars run right up the street alongside the hotel, which provides easy transportation out to Fisherman''s Wharf. Overall, the location was excellent, the service was very good, the rooms were okay. Probably best for couples, not so great for a family. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Some of it is the good fat, Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated, but it does contain 6g of total fat--2g of that Saturated Fat. It also packs 220 calories per 1/2 cup serving, which is about 2 1/2 handfuls, and it's very easy to keep eating it.Since opening the bag, I've probably eaten three servings already, because it's that good, but that can't be good for my waist!OK, I shouldn't be that harsh and deduct 1-star from BACK TO NATURE... for my own lack of will power, but many customers will see the words \"nature\" and \"whole grain\" and think \"healthy treat.\" The small serving size of the granola is also deceptive because many will think \"this is such a tiny amount that I'll just eat a little more\" because it really does seem like you're eating a small amount, but then next thing you know you can't zip up your jeans.On the plus side, that means that the product is delicious but just be aware of serving size and portions.

Theo, the writer, speaks of &#34;...a rainbow edge where beauty comes into being, where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not:  and this is the space where all art exists...&#34;  This is beautifully expessed by Donna Tartt and beautifully demonstrated in her novel.

I did not find the first book interesting at all but decided to really give it a shot and read all three. It was like reading the same awful book three times in a row.1) Characters:The characters are uninteresting and boring. They are taken directly from twilight but made worse. It was almost laughable how much the characters were like their twilight counterparts. But on top of that the hero is abusive. I am not sure why anyone would find him a heart throb. The heroine is a wimp.2) PlotThere is none. Simple as that. I will admit in the second and third books there is a bit more plot but in the first book there is absolutely no plot at all.3) SexWhile I admit the first couple of sex scenes were kind of fun by the end of the first book I was so tired of reading them they just got plain boring. It was the same sex scene over and over again with just a small twist. But they became predictable. The reader knew exactly what would happen, what would he say, what would she say etc... and this does not change for three books. Not to mention the characters have sex like 5 times a day every day. I was begging for them to stop having sex and have a plot but this does not happen. (If I ever hear the phrase inner goddess again...)I honestly could not recommend this book or book series to anyone. There was nothing interesting.

Some rooms had working phones, tvs, lights, other rooms didn't. Very inconsistant. Bedding was dirty, one towel in one room, none in the others. The Managers, who live there with children, were VERY rude!! They called everyone 30 minutes prior to check out to tell us to leave. They charged us $10 more than what we booked on their website - and then argued with us when we brought it to their attention. DO NOT STAY HERE!! Very dishonest people!!! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: 3 &#8220;Riptide&#8221; &#8220;Mine.&#8221; &#8220;Racer&#8220; KissesI am torn. Conflicted. Frustrated. I don't know what to do. Well...I know what I have to do but that doesn't mean that I am going to like doing it. When you know the capabilities of an author...a character...a story line...and when you love it so passionately, anything less than amazing is not good enough. That's what I'm faced with here. I feel like Real set the bar of what I was expecting for the whole series&#8230;and Mine did not measure up in my book. Stone me now&#8230;curse me if you will, believe me, the words that I have to say are not fun for me to admit&#8230;but I can&#8217;t lie about how I feel.Brooke Dumas...did I love everything about Brooke in Real - not exactly but I got over it because for some reason, on some level I connected with her and felt for her. So all the annoying stuff kind of...didn&#8217;t matter. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense but it works in my crazy brain. Well in the beginning of Mine, Brooke drove me about 10 shades of crazy with some of her antics and logic. If you are going to make decisions and then get mad at the results of those decisions...it's time for you to grow up! She was being completely irrational and utterly annoying at times. Drove me bonkers! Because that's not the Brooke I loved in Real. Then, it was like a heavenly light opened up and finally I got my Brooke back. She was strong, not only for herself but for Remy, I loved the way she handled him and their relationship and just&#8230;everything. I was proud of her and how far they had come together.&#8216;I&#8217;ve been broken and put together again.I&#8217;ve been loved, and I have loved.I&#8217;m in love, and I will be forever changed by this man. I used to dream of medals and championships, but now I dream solely of a blue-eyes fighter who one day changed my life, when he put his lips on mine&#8230;&#8217;Remy...Remington Tate deserves a million stars. Ten million. Alright infinity stars - there...it's settled. He is not perfect...he has flaws...he has issues and he is no where near infallible...but the man is so freakin&#8217; in love with Brooke it makes my heart soar. Remy is like no other book bf&#8230;he defies categories and logic because even his wrongs add up to so much right. The #1 thing that has me excited about Remy is the prospect of being in his head. He's just...*sigh*...there are no words. Well...there are actually lots of words....like loving, strong, protective, kind, sexy, alpha, dominating, endearing...he's just so complex and the more I get to know about him the more I crave him. There are so many layers to this chess playing, @#$ kicking, Brooke loving lion. He's like a drug and I totally want to be on a Remy high...forever.&#8216;And I want him like my next breath.I want him more than any one of these screaming women wants im.I want every fragmented part of him. I want his body. His mind. His heart. His beautiful soul.He says he&#8217;s mine, but I know that there&#8217;s a part of Remington Tate nobody will ever have.I am his, but he is untamable and unconquerable.The only one who can defeat Remington Tate is himself.&#8217;The thing that kept this book from being another 5++++ book was the repetitiveness. It was out of control...enough to the point where I was rolling my eyes. A lot. I loathe repetitiveness...I've stopped reading books because of it. What do I mean by repetitiveness? A few examples...talking about &#8216;his hair&#8217;, &#8216;his abs&#8217;, &#8216;his eyes&#8217; &#8211; I get it&#8230;the dude&#8217;s gorgeous, I&#8217;m aware. I love his looks&#8230;but I don't need to be reminded of them all the time, and it was constant. If that was all the repetitiveness then maybe I could have handled it better, but it was also using the same words, over and over, to describe the same things. I didn't understand the point and unfortunately, I needed more than that. They have this great and amazing love and connection &#8211; build off of that. Expand! They&#8217;ve not been in a relationship for that long, I wanna see all of those moments! So what kept me going? One word. Remy. Plain and simple. That's it - his character completely carried this book and made it worth reading for me. Because any other time I would have stopped reading before I reached 50%. I hate saying that. I hate thinking that. It just...sucks.&#8216;My lungs ache for breath and the rest of me aches for his hands on me. And when my gaze flicks upward to find those blue eyes pinned on mine, his face hurt and sweaty, all the testosterone in the world courses through him, pulling and enveloping me, so I can barely take living right now I want him so much . He makes me feel this all-consuming, soul -searing, heart-wrenching, painful need for him that&#8217;s more than physical, more than emotional.&#8217;I was warned about the repetitiveness too...so I was prepared to possibly hate it and maybe that softened the blow a little bit because while it grated on my nerves, I was able to shrug it off and push forward. If I am being honest, I probably would have DNF&#8217;d it had I not been prepared. That makes me want to cry. But despite the annoyance, I was glad I did read it because there were fleeting glimpses of the amazingness that was in Real. Like the amazing quote worthiness...I did swoon and love all my special little Remy moments...he and Brooke still blew me away with their love and devotion to each other. But then that only makes me wonder if the repetitiveness hadn't been so bad...what could this book have been? It's a sad thought to ponder...&#8216;His words caress me.Nobody ever taught him how to love.He does it instinctively.&#8217;I can't lie...this book did evoke emotions out of me, even though the half of the time the emotions were usually out of frustration, that wasn&#8217;t all I felt&#8230; I already admitted I swooned, but I cried, I gasped, it got to my little feelers...so I did have love for this book and that does mean something to me. I am an emotional reader and if an author can still pull emotion out of me even when I'm at my wits end with frustration...that's saying a lot IMO. I did not see a lot of this plot coming, which is another positive thing. I don't know what I was expecting but the story line was definitely unpredictable and I appreciated that it kept me on my toes. And seriously&#8230;the prologue&#8230;L.O.V.E.D. every word.&#8220;Remy . . .&#8221;&#8220;This is the last time I live without you. I&#8217;m half mad already and halfway into the f^@$ing grave. I don&#8217;t like this. Every single monster in my head tells me you&#8217;ll run and I won&#8217;t be close enough to catch you. Every instinct in me screams at me to go get you. Every bone in my body tells me you are MINE&#8212;not a part of me, but my brain understands why the hell I sent you away from me. The rest of me can&#8217;t take it. You can&#8217;t convince the rest of me being away from you is right.&#8221;&#8220;Remington Tate, I swear to you&#8212; I swear&#8212; that when I&#8217;m able to get up from this stupid bed and run again, you&#8217;re always, always, going to be the one thing I&#8217;ll run straight to.&#8221;I will always have a deep love for Remy and Brooke and their story...but I am nervous about what to expect from Remy because I am hearing similar things to what I heard with Mine. So once again...I will prepare myself but keep the hope alive that even though I may not like everything, that my love for the characters will save me from too much disappointment. :-\\ ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is a sloppy-thinker's time travel movie. It is not for the more sophisticated sci-fi fan. Contradictions and silliness abound. Characters are both dead and alive at the same time. They have arms and don't have arms at the same time. We learn later in the film, for example, that the lead character kills himself as a young man but he also makes it into old age (and performs acts such as saving an even younger version of himself from certain death). Characters fear their imminent death yet also know they survive into old age. There are so many other silly contradictions and lazy, hackneyed plot devices that I couldn't enjoy any of the action scenes or other aspects of the film (which now I think about also were rather substandard). It's written by someone who clearly don't have any clear, original ideas (actually it faces many of the contradictory time travel plot scenarios as the Back To the Future movies).Those who can hold a complex, logical thought or two in their heads will likely be disappointed by this movie and maybe even feel a little insulted by the laziness of the screenwriter. For good time travel flicks with consistent, interesting plots, I suggests 12 Monkeys (involving a consistent causal loop) and Source Code (a consistent forking scenario). ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the story?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I'll preface my review by saying that I am only passingly familiar with the play Rent. Before watching the movie, I had been turned onto seeing it after listening to the music from the Broadway show, but I have never seen the play actually performed. As such, I can't really comment on how this film stacks up to the play, only how it stands on its own as a film.What strikes me about Rent early on is the very good acting by all of the cast. For most of this, I can chalk it up to experience with the characters; most of the original cast of the play makes it into the movie and thus they have 10 plus years of working with their parts. However, even the new additions are very well acted. The characters of Rent live a carefree Bohemian lifestyle, but there is still an incredible sadness within them. Most of the cast has AIDS and is doomed to die in a very painful manner. Those who do not have AIDS live with the knowledge that they will have to watch as their friends die. For most of the film, those emotions go unstated, but they are clearly in the background for every character.A solid example of this sadness on the inside comes through during the song \"Another Time,\" when Mimi flirts with Roger and he pushes her away because of his fear of opening up to someone as he dies of the virus. In a very angry song, he breaks down for a moment and begins saying softly, \"I should tell you, I should tell you...\" only to explode in anger again. The performance is very subtle, but Roger's pain remains evident in his voice even as he keeps it hidden. The characters are as real as fictional constructs can be; they do not simply feel happy or sad or angry. They carry around a mix of emotions, and the actors portray those mixed emotions as they try to have a good time in what are potentially their final days.The music of Rent is obviously one of the highlights of the film. Although many songs have been cut out from the play, probably due to the time constraints on a film, the important ones are still there and they still sound terrific. If anything, the cast has improved in their musical talent over the years, and the wide variety of quirky and beautiful songs written by the late Jonathan Larson are all performed to perfection. The music remains important to the plot, advancing the storylines and highlighting all the key moments of the film.Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS. The performances are sharp and the music is terrific. This is a film that will move you from happiness to anger to sadness and back again, covering everything in between along the way.

One of our server's got upset at us because we ordered our dim sum wrong even though we weren't given clear instructions on how to order. It was almost as if our food wasn't cared about. It took them quite a long time to bring our food out and the server's never really checked on our table or answered our requests until like the fifth time we asked them. And it wasn't like this place was busy. This place had like 5 other tables filled and we were the biggest party (13 people). They also forgot to bring out a bunch of food items we ordered. Service was probably the worst part of this place.Food here was like any other regular dim sum, nothing special. It wasn't worth the wait though. If I had to say what my favorite menu item was though, I'd probably say the deep fried shrimp roll (#34).Wouldn't really recommend this place.

So I closed the book and let it go.  When the movie came out and was a huge success I decided I wanted to read it and see the movie, I read about 6 chapters before going to the movie and the writing was really good, after seeing the movie I went home to finish the book.  It did not disappoint.  In fact it had me buying book 2 immediately after and now I'm halfway through it.There isn't much to add to other reviews because everything has been said.  Reading the book at the same time as watching the movie I think they did an excellent adaptation of the story and Suzanne Collins has a beautiful style of writing even when it's something as sad and serious as The Hunger Games.

      "Corresponding review: I've been to El Catrin now three times, though this is my first review. Every visit has been great. I love everything about this place!My most recent visit was at 9 pm on a Saturday night with my friend for a girls' night out. I made the reservation a week in advance, and the only options were for 5:45 pm, 9 pm or 10 pm - and that was a full week in advance! So, if you want to try this place, and want to sit inside I highly recommend making a reservation early!With reservations, you will be seated inside, but there is also an extensive and very festive outside seating area that appears to be first come first served. (And seasonal....) When we arrived at 8:55 pm, the line was very long and the entire outdoor area was packed; when we left at 11 pm, the line was STILL long and the outdoor area STILL packed, so that should tell you something!We started our dining experience with table-side-fresh-made guacamole which is served with fresh-made chips, and traditional margaritas. Our server, Ricardo, was excellent, and our guac came out quick. The person prepping it ground all the ingredients together right in front of us in a stone mortar. I love it when they do that! And it was very tasty, seasoned well, and a good portion size for sharing (though we had to ask for more chips).We then ordered mains off the list of house specialties. I had the Pulpo A La Diabla, which was a grilled octopus tentacle served with picked veggies, slices of orange and a tangy, slightly spicy tomato-based sauce. It was amazing! Ricardo let me know when I ordered it that it was a smaller portion size, and that was perfect for me because I planned to have dessert and at least one more margarita....My friend had the Pipian Poblano, which was actually a chicken dish with a large piece of chicken served over a bed of mole verde risotto. Ricardo told us this was a larger portion size and he was right - it was huge! And very tasty, with great depth of flavors. My friend loved it and almost licked the bowl. Everything was served with three house-made sauces - a very spicy but delicious habanero sauce, a green tomatillo salsa and a red (sweeter) chipotle-ish sauce. We ate these with the chips and also added them to our dishes. During our dinner we ordered another round of drinks - another traditional for my friend, but I branched out to try the Fuego Sandia, made with St. Germaine (my fave) and what tasted like watermelon juice. It was served with a skewer of watermelon and Ricardo described the drink as 'sweet'. He was right again!  And I probably would not order that again....not that it wasn't tasty, but I do prefer drinks with a little more balance.By the time all of that was cleared, we, sadly, (very sadly) had no room for dessert. But we really enjoyed everything about the experience. All around us people were celebrating events and birthdays, there were couples and groups dining together, and the atmosphere was hip and a little fancy, but also comfortable and eclectic. I highly recommend this place! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Not overly sweet with a nice apple, cinnamon, and graham flavor to them.Whole oats sprinkled on top were more for looks than anything else and there is a slight tendency for these crackers to gum up in your teeth if you eat them too fast.  Nevertheless, the texture is light and crispy.There are three packs of crackers in each box which is nice to not have to worry about the uneaten portions going stale.Also nice was the packaging such that there was very little wasted space inside the box.

I can't say I prefer these over Reese's, but they're pretty great.Both the chocolate and filling taste like what you'd expect from a Butterfinger, but that filling is so creamy and filled with small bits of Butterfinger crumbs. Where Reese's peanut butter filling is almost dry and crumbly, this is thick and viscous. You won't have to worry about getting &#34;Butterfinger teeth&#34; because there isn't enough of that crunchy stuff to glom up in your teeth. It also isn't as intensely peanut butter-y tasting, which is to be expected given that it should taste more like a Butterfinger.I like to freeze these cream-filled candies because the flavor often intensifies when frozen, but the opposite was true with the Butterfingers. The flavor straight out of the box is mild but notable, and doesn't have that somewhat salty strength that Reese's does. But frozen, it seems to lose much of its flavor, and the chocolate becomes almost plastic-like. Not recommended. Just eat 'em straight out of the package. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Spent 3 days, 2 nights at the Union Square Hotel and absolutely loved it. We got a great deal through the reservation line ($79/night) and later found out that there was a huge convention in town, and that we were incredibly lucky to get a room at all, let alone such a great rate.The location is unbeatable - we took the cable car from our hotel direct to Ghirardelli Square in less than 15 minutes. Within walking distance of fantastic restaurants, shopping, and San Francisco sightseeing.We had heard about noise complaints, so we asked for a courtyard view room and it was completely silent. The room was small by American hotel standards, but we really didn't spend too much time in the room and it was more than adequate.I have stayed in all the major upscale hotel chains across the country, and by no means is this hotel meant to compete - but if you're looking for an affordable, clean, well-maintained hotel in a great location, this is the hotel for you.One last thing - the staff was one of the nicest I've ever experienced, and this includes all my stays at nicer, more upscale hotels.

      "Corresponding question: How is the price?\n",
      "Corresponding review: AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, Any other positive you can think of.  I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: When Aileen Wournos was at large, I was in my teens and living in Central Florida, following the story with sick fascination.  I grew up in Marion County, and the first thing I looked for when I saw this movie was accurate depiction of the area, accents, and overall look of the sets. Gotta say, I felt like I was home again.Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation for this movie, where she plays Central Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Not only is the make up and the extra thirty pounds striking as she was uglied down for this role, but her mannerisms, accent and general attitude complete the illusion. Charlize looks so much like Aileen Wournos that when you put her picture next to the real killer's, the resemblance is so uncanny that it gives chills. She also looks a lot like James Hetfield of Metallica fame, but then, so did Aileen Wournos.Her performance is perfect, and Christina Ricci as her selfish, lesibian lover gives a performance that is also well worth watching. Ignorant of her lover's crimes, she pushes her to make more money for them, never realizing until much later that the money is coming from the dead men that are appearing all over Central Florida.Are we expected to feel sorry for Aileen Wournos now that we have the background on how and why she snapped and became this monster? Are we supposed to be sorry that we went to the electric chair? No. While this movie shows us that Aileen's first murder was in self defense, and the second murder was made easier by the post traumatic stress of her first experience, we also see that the other killings are completely calculated and her victims were generally innocent people. Briefly, we see her anguish at killing during an especially disturbing murder scene, but Wournos was not that sorry, so that scene doesn't inspire sympathy for her so much as it leaves a person feeling cold.I would have given this movie five stars except for one thing. The relationship she has with Shelby (Ricci) is too drawn out and slow in developing at first. Then, it seems to be more important than the murders, because we have more screen time with Theron and Ricci making out, arguing, or otherwise planning their next move than we do anything else, which seems to put the murders on the backburner.However, if you want disturbing non-fiction, this movie disturbs on two levels. The first is Charlize Theron herself. She is freakin' amazing. The second is the actual story. It is very hard to watch, but you will be glad you did. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the quality of the film?\n",
      "Corresponding review: At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing & worth writing about.Batman Begins (Batman 5) is bigger, better & bolder than all its predecessors. The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman & not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.This movie is Batman all the way. The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role. He might seem a bit too young for the role of Bruce Wayne however we need to keep in mind that this is Batman \"Begins\" hence him being young.The entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things. The Batmobile was a bit rugged as opposed to refined, the three main fight scenes (The one in jail, the one at the School & the last one) were really quick & you can't quite make heads or tales of it. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie the weather was probably cold but Christopher Nolan did not have to use Katie Holmes' assets to get the message across - on IMAX it is very evident - for those who have no clue what I am talking about, watch the movie & you decide.As for the cast; excellent choice, everyone of them. Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his \"mentor\" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her. She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies & is dating Tom Cruise. Life is good. I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike. Bale is great as Batman & is very convincing. Great movie, well made, well filmed & I am sure it'll be well liked as well.Rating: 4 &  stars.

      "Corresponding review: So, first--I'll say it outright: I read about halfway through this book. And normally, I'd never write a review for a book I haven't read from cover to cover, but many friends convinced me to post this review, especially since Amazon has this book listed as \"Amazon Children's Publsihing\" (yes, Amazon even misspelled publishing on its own book!). I've read enough YA that didn't have language to know it's possible to carry a strong story with strong emotions without resorting to curse words, ESPECIALLY in a book slated for \"children.\" It's almost as if the words were inserted to make the characters sound tougher, and it just didn't work.Another thing that bothered me is that blatant attitude toward God--I get it; a lot of people are on that hate bandwagon when it comes to anything Christian (and I'm sure that hatred will rear its head in response to my review), but this book had too much for me. Sorry, when one of God's angels says \"we're all just stumbling around in the dark,\" and mutters something about an empty story that sounds profound to explain his presence, and curses like everyone else...well, there's no hero in that story for me. I'm not looking for every title to espouse my beliefs, but when the book begins to feel like an attack or seems to have an agenda--and that includes Christian fiction--rather than a good story, I'm outta there.I did give this a 2-star rating because the concept was unique and intriguing--which is what attracted me to the book in the first place--and the writing was pretty decent. Unfortunately, language and a clash of belief sets ruined the book for me. I can, and do, tolerate a lot of things in the fiction I read, but this one crossed lines for me. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The room was fantastic and they even put a complimentary bottle of wine in our room as a gift for our honeymoon (nice touch). We had an extra night in San Fransico at the end of our trip so rebooked at this hotel. The second room was again lovely, however the walls were a little thin, but to be honest it didn't bother us at all and I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. Every morning there was a complimentary basic breakfast (which was everything we wanted, cereal, pastries, coffee, tea, juice, toast etc) in the sitting room and in the evenings they had complimentary wine and cheese, and it was good! The Hotel itself is situated in Pacific Heights which in my opinion is nicest area of San Fransico but it is a $5-$10 taxi ride from Fishermans Wharf etc - however the hotel is in walking distance of some awesome resteraunts &amp; the area is very safe and and is really a tourist attraction itself. The Hotel will also organise for Resteraunt delivery if you require it. On the last day, they arranged for late check out because we didn't have to go to the airport until later, they also arranged a town car to pick us up and whilst we were waiting for the town car we sat in the waiting area.... Which was fully equiped with biscuits, newpapers, tea, coffee and some really comfortable chairs. To sum up - Thank you for being so wonderful, I can not reccommend this hotel enough &amp; to be honest if it is available your crazy if you don't book it.

      "Corresponding review: A long absent evil returns to loom over the Free Lands of Middle Earth, and it needs only the One Ring to become an unstoppable force of destruction. Luckily, the One Ring of Power, lost for over three thousand years, has come into the hands of a humble, young hobbit named Frodo Baggins. With the benign wizard Gandalf the Grey to instruct him, Frodo and his best friend, Samwise Gamgee, travel with two other hobbit companions to the woodland realm of the elves, led by a mysterious ranger called Strider. Once there, the band of heroes is joined by Legolas the Elf, a nobleman named Boromir, and Gimli the dwarf, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the quest of the Fellowship to take the evil Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, in the land of Mordor, to destroy it. It is a perilous journey, however. Along the way, they must face monstrous creatures such as Orcs, Ringwraiths, Cave Trolls, Goblins, and all manner of other horrors. But, they will also discover the distant majesties of their world, the fascinating cultures, beautiful beings, and awe inspiring landscapes.  They must always remain on guard though, because there are less obvious dangers lurking as well. The Dark Lord Sauron's demonic eye is ever watchful, his spies seek out the hobbits in search of the One Ring, and the ring itself is the greatest danger of all. Its wicked power seeks to envelop all who are near and lead them to certain doom.Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" is only the first in a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is pointless to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. The visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The languages are real, the various cultures are in depth, and at the heart of it all is the message that no creature is so small that it is insignificant or incapable of making a difference. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 3 featurettes on the making of the film, 15 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a music video by Enya, a preview of the second film in the trilogy (Two Towers) and its video game, and, believe it or not, a preview of the extended edition of the DVD. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the \"preferred versions.\" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose. Fantastic films!In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, \"The Hobbit.\" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for \"Lord of the Rings\" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out a much younger Elijah Wood in \"The Adventures of Huck Finn,\" another of my all-time favorite films, and pick up Peter Jackson's \"King Kong,\" another extraordinary achievement! Oh, and visit my gallery at slave2moonlight.deviantart.com to read my Disney/Lord of the Rings fan-comic! It's only 7 pages in as I write this review, but it's somewhat entertaining if I do say so myself, ha. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

It's a unique flavor.  Somewhat like iced coffee with milk, but still different.  I enjoy the flavor, but it's not going to be like drinking an iced mocha coffee with cream/milk from your local cafe.I would compare this closely to some of the Java Monster energy drinks that I've had, more specifically the Mocha version of it.  The difference being that here you only get 8.45 ounces instead of the 16+ oz of the monster, and you're only getting coffee here with no additional craziness, which is good.I haven't had illy coffee that much, just a few times in Europe, and then some espresso pods for a cheap espresso machine I had, so I can't really fully say if it lives up to the name, but it was smooth coffee, albeit with chocolate and milk mixed in as well.  I'm not sure the price justifies how much you get, or the name on it in this case. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Before I started Hopeless, I was seeing it everywhere! Every blog I stopped by was featuring Hopeless and everyone was raving about it and how amazing it was. Of course, after seeing how everyone was smitten with it, I had to give it a try. I'm sorry to say that it took me a long time to get to it, but once I did I was shocked. Like really, really shocked, so shocked I had to take a break between chapters. I honestly had not expected what I found. I was expecting a book about a bad boy meeting a good girl who pushes him away because of his tattoos or something like that.Hopeless was more than that, there is some pushing away but not because Sky is a good girl and Holder is a bad boy, even though he might seem scary in the first chapters. I don't want to spoil the book, because you have to experience all the feelings the book evokes. And dear good, there are a lot of feels.Suffice to say, I absolutely love this book! It's heart-breaking, it will no doubt make you cry your heart out, but there are moments in this book that will make you laugh out loud. I loved Sky and Holder together. Their humor, their wit and banter just added another flavor to the book. Them together was effortless, not effortless as in they didn't encounter any problems, but effortless as in they were so much alike, their relationship and feelings didn't feel forced but flowed easily and wasn't something I had a hard time getting used to. Now I'm going to sound corny, but they fit together perfectly and I loved it. It felt real.They both went through problem, devastating problems and discoveries that I had not seen coming. I thought I had everything figured out from the first half of the book and that I knew what the twist was. Well, what I had figured out was right, even though I didn't want it to be because it was just too horrible, but the real twist totally made me stop, cry for half an hour, and then go back to reading again.Hopeless is a phenomenal book and an emotional roller coaster with amazing characters. A must-read. I'm totally calling dips on Holder, the guy is just so swoon-worthy and amazing and I love him so much. He is so understanding even though he suffered a lot and went through heart-breaking things that would devastate most. So people, go buy this book! It's worth every penny! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: \"Ray,\" Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.  I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get \"Hit the Road Jack\" out of my head.There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.  The worst of these are the \"Aha!\" moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.  There is too much foreshadowing and melodrama, and the direction and cinematography sometimes lack the subtlety that would have made \"Ray\" a truly great movie.Still, you should see \"Ray\" for the three or four very fine performances and for the superb music.  These alone are worth the price of admission. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I love visiting Colette Cafe not just for their delicious teas and caffinated beverages but also to admire their beautiful interior design and decor. For those who know me, my absolute favourite colour is blue. They just make everything look so elegant and precious. I'm literally obsessed with every detail they have from tiles, paint, furniture and fixtures. It's very European, which they are, and I absolutely adore. I never really had the chance to pick out anything other than their hot beverages and a buttered almond croissant here and there, but they most certainly offer items such as baguettes, cupcakes, special donuts, cake, macarons, quiches and salads. Honestly I get so focused and fixated on their restaurant designs that I lose focus on the actual menu itself. I'm don't have much of a sweet tooth so I'm not necessarily drawn to the sweet items like most of my friends do. Other than that, if you enjoy tea they have a wide selection of aromatic teas to choose from. Colette also has a really great patio which is open during the warmer months. It is located on a smaller street in Toronto so if you like a more quiet, outdoor environment to do work you may want to check this place out. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: No doubt this place is beautiful. Located in the heart of King West, Patria is both fun and sophisticated, and a great environment for group dinners or dates. Definitely upscale, but not so much that the environment is uptight and constricting. It's just the right amount of class and liveliness. Intricate designs on the walls, carefully planned lighting, tasteful and trendy furniture and decor - I really enjoyed the setting.First, the parking situation. We found parking for $6.00 on a Friday evening in a parking garage at King Street and Spadina Avenue, just east of the restaurant. Second, the service. Super friendly, pleasant, and honest. Our waiter even stopped us from ordering more food, letting us know when we ordered too much (his recommendations were on point - we ordered just enough).Third, while the environment and the service were excellent, the food was just alright. We ordered: a) jamon serrano, b) meatballs, c) bacon covered dates, d) empanadas, e) chicken paella, and f) a glass of red sangria, To be honest, I couldn't hold down the bacon wrapped dates (I don't enjoy dates to begin with, so this was definitely not for me). The jammon serrano (aged for 24 months) was just fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the empanadas and meatballs - while it tasted fine enough, we've definitely had better elsewhere. The chicken paella was the best item out of everything we had, full of flavour and texture. Definitely try this if you're here for dinner.Overall, we'd come back here for a group dinner or to start off a fun evening, but we wouldn't come back for the food or if tasty food was our priority. On the whole, Patria isn't bad, but it's not the best. Also, we weren't too hungry to begin with, so we were fine with portion size, but if you are coming super hungry, note that there's a good chance you'll find portion size a bit small. For our entire order, with tax, and tip, our total came to around $120. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the photo?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Of course, there is no such thing as the perfect camera.  But man, does this come close!  I have never been so happy with a camera -- and I've owned quite a few.Right off the bat, the sensor size is larger than on your average P&S; (point and shoot) camera, but the resolution isn't any higher.  This allows the camera to take MUCH better pictures in low light.  And you will be amazed at how good this camera is in low light!  Short of a DSLR camera, it has no equal.In addition, this camera is built for the serious enthusiast.  Full manual controls make it almost like having a DSLR in your pocket!  And there is a control dial plus a control ring -- making it much easier to control your settings.  Plus, a fast lens and the ability to shoot in RAW ... no wonder so many photographers consider this the best pocket camera available.  And yet, you can keep it in Auto mode and treat it like any other point & shoot.Oh, and the LCD is truly beautiful!The main thing that keeps it from being \"perfect\" in my estimation is the limited zoom: less than 4X.  I need much more zoom.  But I'd give it all up for this camera!  And, if you want to use the camera as a camcorder, the standard definition video mode is a bit disappointing.  Why not high-def, Canon?The main problems with the camera are pretty minor.  The control dial on the back is very loose and you have to be careful not to accidentally change your settings.  It's also a shame that you can't independently set the control dial and control ring for whatever you want: instead, you have to choose among a number of pre-sets.  It's a little disappointing.  And, if you are very serious, it's worth noting the serious barrel distortion in RAW; but the camera takes care of that in processing JPEGs, so most will never know.Some people complain about the build quality.  Trust me, it's perfectly fine.  It's light, which can be misleading.  But there's nothing wrong with the build quality.  Perhaps they expect more for $400.  I guess I can understand that.  But I'm perfectly comfortable with the build quality.The competition for this camera are the Panasonic LX3, the Fujifilm F200EXR, and maybe the Sony WX1 or TX1.  The Sonys are good low-light cameras, but have no manual controls.  The LX3 and the F200EXR are more serious cameras, but they are no better than the S90 and much more difficult to use.  The S90 seems to get things right right out of the box more often than these others ... from all that I have heard, anyway.  I don't have any of these cameras.  But don't discount ease of use when you consider the competition.I give this camera the highest recommendation possible, even if it's not quite perfect! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Our room was in a back corner of a hotel. The hotel room was large and clean, but was dimmly lit and had a musty smell. I attempted to open the window in the bathroom to get some fresh air, and the window pain nearly fell out of the window frame! Although this was a reasonably priced hotel, the location is awful! We didn't realize what the neighborhood was like when we drove to the hotel, but we quickly learned. There are many adult stores nearby, a lot of borded-up store fronts and a lot of homeless. Near the hotel we passed a man in hand cuffs surrounded by at least 6 police officers. Although the hotel itself was fine, I was very happy to leave the hotel due to it's location. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship \"Acheron\", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.The captain of the \"Acheron\" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004 ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Stayed here for July 4th weekend, 2008. Hotel is 4 story building, conveniently located right by Fisherman's Wharf. At check-in, they placed me in 4th floor King bed room. Decor is colorful and fun. Room included a 42 inch LCD tv and even offered a few HD channels. Parking was expensive at $43/night but that is pretty standard in cities like San Francisco. We were able to walk a couple blocks to get to Fisherman's Wharf - a great area to stroll around and browse the various seafood, shops, and views off the piers. We were able to get to Chinatown with a 15 minute walk. The two things I loved about this hotel - the breakfast buffet and the outdoor firepits. Outside there are several semi-private sitting areas, each of which included a firepit. We bought a bottle of wine and just chilled outside, a fantastic and cozy way to finish off the night. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was pleasantly surprising. They offered small personal frypans with cooked veggie omelettes and home fries. My gf got a strawberry yogurt parfait while I was scooping up the salmon lox with capers. There was plenty of the standard continental fare in addition to the fresh mixed fruits. We had two complimentary passes but I saw from the menu it was rather expensive at $22+ per person. I would recommend based on value, location, and the firepits! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I read reviews where people said the characters are unlikable. My wife dropped watching after 20 minutes saying two main characters are jerks and she doesn't feel any empathy for them. Well, all I can say - don't stop watching after the beginning - this movie really deserves to be seen. Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life. This is very true-life film in general. The genre is hard to define, it's just a movie about life.Characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, \"Sideways\" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also. You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And especially if you're a man. Because practically Giamatti and Church personify here two types of men that exist on our planet. So anyway you can identify yourself with one or another. Both are lonely although differently, both are struggling to find themselves in life although again their lives and nature are very different. They try to find love and some meaning as all of us so I can't imagine this movie leaving someone apathetic. It's really touching and although it's not a tear-jerker sometimes you feel like crying. And don't be ashamed of it - it's a real man's movie and those will be real man's tears. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This movie, (considered a comedy but is also a beautiful love story)based on Truman Capote's classic novel, not only has beautiful color, and pretty scenes around New York, but depicts a beautiful, warm story about a confused, young girl (who lives for nothing but donning herself with a black party gown and a large, black, wide brim fashionable hat and going window-shopping at Tiffany's with her \"breakfast\" of a small cup of coffee and two doughnuts) who also cannot face reality and thus lives in her own private world which to her is filled with nothing but happiness. She is loved by struggling writer Paul Varjak; he not only falls in love with her, but he loves her and becomes strongly concerned about her, so much so that he breaks off his indiscreet affair with a married lady, an interior decorator who, in one sense, uses him. (The versatile Patricia Neal plays the part of the interior designer perfectly.)This is quite a successful directing feat for Blake Edwards, and Henry Mancini provides a beautiful music score for this classic movie.Audrey Hepburn portrays so well the beautiful, mixed-up Holly Golightly, originally a girl who has run away from a marriage with a doctor from Tulip, Texas;Buddy Ebsen does a good turn in this minor role as the doctor. She encounters Paul Varjak (played so well by George Peppard) and their romance shortly begins. Without ever asking questions about her, he sees perfectly that she is in actuality not happy and, again, mixed-up. Because Holly senses love from him, she does believe that he strongly cares about her and genuinely wants to help her. The ending is sad yet very happy. I have never become jaded from watching this wonderful movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Get ready to be swept away by the next installment of one of the most loved and watched sci-fi movies of all time... Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue. For any one who isn't a fan of Star Wars or enjoys solid movies with a plot feel free to pass on this popular yet boring movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This hotel did not disappoint. It has beautiful decor with a nautical theme. Our room was delightful and immaculately clean. Our first reaction walking in was wow! We have stayed in many hotels, some with larger rooms but without the charm of this one. We were right on Fisherman''s Wharf beside the cable car turn a round and the marine museum. It doesn''t get any better than that. There was complimentary wine in the lobby for guests between 5 and 6. Dinner at the Blue Mermaid was quite good, the crab and corn chowder was delicious. Our only small complaint was the steep cost of calling long distance from our room...lesson learned. Other than that, I don''t thing we could stay anywhere else downtown SF after being spoiled here. We definitely would recommend this gorgeous hotel! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Film noir continues to be one of the most difficult genres to make well particularly today (I'd note for purists that film noirs are largely in black & white a fixture of the genre). Film directors can't hide the flaws of a noir behind big explosions, car chases or visual effects. \"L.A. COnfidential\" probably isn't for everyone because it combines the film noir genre with a solid mystery and strong dramatic performances.Set in Los Angeles during the early 1950's, \"L.A. Confidential\" opens with a bang quite literally--Three very different detectives the by-the-book golden boy Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), the hard nosed violent Bud White (Russell Crowe) and the celebrity obsessed Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)try and unravel the conspiracy behind a seemingly random shotgun slaying at a popular diner and how it is tied into the murders of organized crime kingpin Mickey Cohen's gang. The three detectives make a reluctant team hoping to solve the crime and achieve their own personal agendas in the process. They also must find out how Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger) a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake and a cavalcade of other hookers made up to look like Hollywood stars figure into all of this.Well directed by Curtis Hansen from a terrific script by Brian Helgeland and Hansen that manages to adapt James Ellroy's novel without betraying its story or atmosphere, \"L.A. Confidental\" was nominated for a bucket load of Oscars winning two for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Bassinger). The entire cast is terrific from Crowe to Danny DeVito who plays Sid Huggins the editor of the scandal rag L.A. Confidential. Spacey plays oily Vincennes with confidence and style while Crowe embodies the brutal force of Bud White. Pearce who plays Exley the son of a highly regarded murdered police officer gives depth to a character that could easily have been cookie cutter.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning particularly. How does this look in comparison to the 1998 original DVD release? There's greater detail and sharpnes. The original DVD was one of the best transfers of its era (and still holds up remarkably well). The new DVD also looks sharper but the Blu-ray manages to capture the golden cinematography Oscar nominated Dante Spinotti perfectly.We get a great mix of previously released extras ported over from the first \"Special Edition\" when DVDs were still being released in snapcases to some stunning brand new ones as well. The best here is the audio compilation of comments by the director, cast and crew. Although it isn't as fascinating as a scene specific commentary track, it allows each important member of the creative team to give their thoughts on shooting the film, the characters and the story.\"Whatever You Desire\" is a brand new 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. \"Sunlight to Shadows\" another new extra focuses on the cinematography. \"The Cast\" is pretty self explanatory focuses on the seven main characters and two relative \"unknowns\"-Pearce and Crowe. \"From Book to Screen\" gives us Hansen and Helgland discussing the difficulty of translating Ellroy's terrific novel to the screen without sacrificing too much of the story or characters. We also get two very neat extras--\"L.A. Confidential\" a 2003 pilot for a TV series that was to star Keifer Sutherland and a second disc that gives us a sampler of the soundtrack featuring the following songs: Johnny Mercer and the Pied Pipers -- \"Ac-Cent-tchu-ate The Positive\"Chet Baker -- \"Look for the Silver Lining\"Betty Hutton -- \"Hit the Road to Dreamland\"Kay Starr -- \"Wheel of Fortune\"Jackie Gleason -- \"But Not For Me\"Dean Martin -- \"Powder Your Face With SunshineThe DVD set has three discs if you count the sampler while the Blu-ray has two. A terrific 10th Anniversary reissue I'm glad this reissue wasn't kept off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: The pace is even more fast and furious ( pardon my pun )\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the pace?\n",
      "Corresponding review: There's usually a lot of reviews from U.S. viewers and relatively few from European viewers at Amazon. Let's try to set that right a little. Pirates Of The Caribbean 2, or in short Pirates 2, rocks !!! Like its predecessor did (Pirates 1). The pace is even more fast and furious (pardon my pun). It stars even more exotic, sometimes frightening or repulsive figures, like Davy Jones and Co. and Bootstrap Bill. For pure entertainment value, it is an excellent, smartly put together movie. I watched it in the movie theater together with my 13-year old son. We both enjoyed it tremendously. Everything is done with so much class and care for detail and sense of humour. As it ought to be, if you have a budget of well over $ 200 million to spend. We specifically liked The Flying Dutchman and its crew. OK, so there are a few holes in the script and at certain points the explanation lacks. Not a little, but a lot ! But who cares ? Explaining it all would have necessitated a fourth movie. Not that we would have minded, though. In all Pirates 2 is a delicious, almost 2,5 hour rollercoaster ride, with Johnny Depp who carries the whole movie almost alone (as he did the previous part of the saga). With Captain Jack Sparrow he has created a movie figure that has already become legendary in its own time and will become a classic for the ages for sure. Captain Jack's every line was a feast in itself. We both can't wait for Pirates 3 to come out and hope that the DVD-edition for home viewing will come soon and equipped with lots of savvy extra's. The cliffhanger ending in itself is not too bad (I see similarities with the search for Han Solo in the Star Wars saga), but in my opinion the film could have been even better if it had had more of a closure.

      "Corresponding review: I was looking forward to trying this cereal, because not too long ago I was able to try a wonderful granola cereal by Nature's Path, which I liked very much.So, I expected to like this cereal too.  Unfortunately I don't!  I poured alittle bit of the cereal into a bowl.  On my first bite what I tasted seemed salty to me.  I also do not really taste a vanilla flavor, or much of a vanilla flavor.I love the flavor vanilla, especially if it's real vanilla flavoring, but there is also another mainstream brand of cereal that also came in a vanilla flavor that so many people also seemed to love, and I didn't really care for that cereal either.It does look interesting when you pour the cereal into your bowl, different shapes, which consist of corn, rice,flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.When I read the nutrition facts, except for the fact that this cereal is organic, which to me is major, the health benefits really are no better than even alot of mainstream cereals, this cereal is no higher in important nutrients.The total carbohydrates per 2/3 Cup serving is 25 grams, which is 8%,dietary fiber is 3 grams, which is 12%, and sugars is 7 grams.  The sodium level is only 130 mg, which is only 5%.  There is only 1 gram of total fat, and 4% iron.  I would call this a reasonably healthy cereal, and it is gluten free.Iam not impressed.  I wish I were.  It does not keep me from wanting to try other Nature's Path products, but Iam disappointed to find that I did not like this cereal after reading such wonderful feedback about it.Maybe I just don't like vanilla flavored cereals?

      "Corresponding review: The Whitcomb is in a great location, right on Market Street with direct access to SF public transportation and only a few minutes' walk from the Union Square area. The public facilities (lobby, ballroom and meeting rooms) are nice and well-maintained. However, the guest room I was in was quite small, with just enough room for the two double beds and a desk and not much more, and the bathroom was almost an afterthought (the sink was almost on top of the toilet). Other rooms I was in throughout the weekend all appeared to be larger. There was also the occasional odd odor in the room, but this was not a large issue.The front desk staff occasionally appeared to be overwhelmed, with a line sometimes forming at all hours of the day. At check-in, I had to repeat myself two or three times because I was getting asked the same question.Overall, I would recommend the hotel if you get a good deal on it while staying in San Francisco. I'd suggest that if you get a really small room (like 572), ask for something bigger, because they definitely have rooms that are. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Pros: 1. Animation: really superb. Some of the locales in the movie (eg. Rampunzel's tower, the Castle and surrounding town)will take your breath away.2. Humor: Humor for the most part is a success. A lot of the humor is very cliche -- you've seen it all before in Disney features.There are several jokes that are work, however, and they are quite memorable.Cons: 1. Pacing: story really drags in a lot of places, and this ultimately the downfall of the movie. Every time the lead character would break into YETANOTHER musical, I would cringe. Story would have been much served being a fast-paced action adventure with a lot of humor interspersed (like anAladdin).2. Weak forgettable characters: I like the lead character of Rampunzel, and the villaness. The other characters were totally forgettable -- thevarious sidekicks (eg. the iguana and the horse Maximus), inserted for comic relief, were actually for the most part annoying rather thanhumorous.Conclusion: worth a single viewing to see the amazing animation, but its ultimately not a keeper -- rent it dont buy it.

      "Corresponding review: More like a 3.5, not 4.  But I will be nice since it's fairly new. So.  I was really prepared to love this resto.. I remember seeing raving reviews from a few foodie friends that went and getting hyped about trying the items on their menu.  However, I was ill-prepared in doing my homework for which dishes to order, which led to a couple bad choices on our part.Small Plates-TABLE SIDE WELLINGTON COUNTY BEEF TARTARI mean.. I like it, I just don't love it.  It had a tangy kick similar to the horse tartar I had at Black Hoof, but the seasoning wasn't all there and while I enjoyed the first few bites, I kind of got bored half way through.  The bread it came with complemented the dish well, but.. it was alright.  -FRENCH ONION SOUPI didn't pick this one; but we both thought this was a bit too salty... Duncan House's French onion soup blew this one out of the waters and I honestly couldn't have any more after two spoonfuls.  Too much salt, the cheese couldn't even be the saving grace.. nor could the lovely bread.  Large PlatesHUNTER'S STEW - Rabbit, pheasant sausage, beef cheek, whole mustard sauceGod I loved the pheasant sausage.  I thought it would taste like chicken.. but nope.  It The mustard sauce complimented the protein so perfectly, and while I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie medley in the stew, the sausage made the dish for me.  Rabbit meat also had a more distinctive taste than the last time I had it at Luma.Recommended!DRUNKEN TUNA - Seared ahi, red pepper pesto, pomme purée, rocket salad, sherry vinaigretteThe tuna was done medium rare - on the rarer side.  I thought it was really flavourful but the birthday boy I came with thought it was a little salty.  To each their own but this was recommended to us by the waiter and I really liked the red pepper pesto on the side as well when I dipped the tuna in it :)  YUM.DessertMACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHESHonestly just ordered this one so I could have a birthday message for the birthday boy.  It was really nice that when I included my request in my reservation in Open Table, they remembered and spelt on a message with chocolate & added a candle and everything!  I hear they give complimentary desserts to birthday guests anyway.  The dessert itself.. well, I had better macarons for sure.  The ice cream and sorbet were delish (raspberry sorbet, bailey's ice cream, and vanilla) - but the macarons were a little disappointing.Overall, the ambiance was fantastic and makes the resto very fit for a special occasion.  Especially around the holiday times when the Christmas Market is going on and everything in the distillery is absolutely beautiful. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I found this movie to be very well-acted and well-directed.The sexual scenes didn't bother me not one bit, like some of the other reviewers.I mean, COME ON!!---This is life in the 21st Century!--Grow up already!People get naked and they interact, okay?---Thank goodness that computers and gadgetshaven't spoiled that for us (yet!), as it has with basic conversational skills and other formsof by-gone or slowly dying human interaction.I actually know both a lesbian couple, as well as a gay male couple whoare living similar circumstances as in the premise of this movie.I found it very modern, refreshing, and mature in it's approach to the subject matter.I have long been a fan of Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore and Annette Benning's work,and I also thought \"the kids\" themselves did an excellent job at portraying their roles.My problem was in that I felt like the Mark Ruffalo character kind of had his once happyand balanced, (for him), life just upheaved and torn apart when he gets contacted by these \"kids\",who of course, have every right to know who their father / donor was, and also what his background is.Ruffalo's character had a great attitude (I thought) about the whole thing...He was naturally pensive and cautious at first, though not in a malicious way, but soon warmed to theidea that he had these \"kids\" in his life now, and was more than open to getting to know them, and allowthem to get to know him. I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to justbeing an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybodyelse's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guiltyabout all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!I always say: \"Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!\" (-:Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, couldonly end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the \"kids\",after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...As if to say, \"Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!\"This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally lefton the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.Not cool, I felt. )-:Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own businessand his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' livesjust as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit& optimism, being dejected and disregarded. Just my humble opinion of course. (-:I still enjoyed this movie though, despite its (what I considered to be) plot flaws. **4 Stars** ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

However, I think the price for Avitae water is just too high for what it offers.  There are caffeine tablets that I've read about and may try if I decide to eliminate all pop from my daily routine.

Bottom line there is price seems equivalent to, or maybe slightly higher than, similar snacks from a vending machine.These crackers are tasty -- the cracker is crispy, the cheesy filling is flavorful -- but I'm not that impressed with them overall.

      "Corresponding review: I first learned about this book through the National Novel Writer's Month website -- this book was listed as being written by a NaNoWriMo participant, and the author stated that this book was a product of said event.  Being a NaNoWriMo writer myself, I was heartened to learn that someone had not only published a book produced during the event, but said book had been successful enough to warrant bestseller status and a movie deal.  So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.The titular \"Night Circus\" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the \"Twilight\" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

San Francisco is our favorite city and we look forward to the trip all year, mostly because we love the Ritz so much. The service from the minute you arrive is perfect. The bellmen are professional, knowledgable and a few have been working there for over 10 years. Staying on the Club level is one of the best parts of our stay. The food is beautifully done and always fresh. The concierge help make reservations at restaurants that would otherwise be hard to book on such short notice. They are friendly and down to earth, without lacking professionalism. We have stayed in a one bedroom suite on both occasions and love the furnishings, size and the beautiful bathrooms. The location is perfect; close enough to North Beach to walk, one major hill from Union Square, and a few steps from the trolly line at Powell. All of the restaurants in the hotel are worth trying . The Dining Room has some of the best service I've ever had. If you enjoy French food, it is a must. The Terrace for lunch is great, the servers are friendly, the decor beautiful and the food just as perfect as would be expected. We spend a few evening at the casual restaurant in the lobby, which is a quiet place to relax with a fireplace and piano. Lastly, the spa, fitness facilities and pool are also perfect. I had the best massage I've had in the state of California at the Ritz. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Fortuantely, there is no \"sawdust\" feel as I swallow, just a bit of grainyness that you might expect from a healthy raw fruit and nut bar.  All in all, a very pleasant and tasty experience.

      "Human answer: Each packet is good for a 16 oz drink\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the packet?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is not the ideal or the most nutritious of drinks, but if it stops you from drinking sugary drinks, then it is definitely an alternative to consider.The taste is mostly strawberryish in a Kool Aid kind of way. I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink. If you find it too rich, you can always increase the amount of water or use one packet to make drinks for multiple people.One packet has 10 calories, all sugars. There is no other nutritional value on the label.If you are cautious about artificial sweeteners, this one has sucralose.The green tea is decaf, and indeed I did not feel a caffeine kick.The outside box is nice and colorful, but the drink definitely doesn't taste as good as it looks in the picture.The bottom of the outside box and the individual packets show an expiration date, but it is not written in a straightforward fashion from a consumer's perspective.The overall rating is closer to 3.5 stars out of five, but closer to a 4 than a 3. It gets bonus points for reasonable taste and convenience, but sucralose brings it down. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Firstly, I am picky with water. I do not like Aquafina or Dasani because I think they taste like the plastic bottle. My favorite waters are Deer Park and Poland Spring. Both have a clean, crisp flavor, with no funky after taste or odd plastic taste.Essentia has a nice clean, fresh taste. Just pure clean water. No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it. I myself cannot see spending so much on bottled water, although it does have a very good, pure taste. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The main character is pretty flat, even with the attempt at making him three-dimensional - but it didn't really matter because it was plenty enough for us to root for him.*** mini-spoilers ahead:  ***As to the complaints about the aliens being \"dumb\", one character notes more than once that it's as if they are Chris Columbus coming to America and we're the \"Indians\".  So... think about it.  When the Europeans came to the Americas, they didn't try to kill everyone.  They came and if the native people were nice, other than disease, they left it alone more or less.  But if the natives were aggressive then they were attacked.  If you pay attention you'll notice the aliens don't shoot first.  I thought of it as the aliens were making some attempt at peaceful approach but fought to stay alive, and were individuals in that some were trigger happy and others were possibly pacifist and maybe don't agree with the alien invasion plans... maybe that's why... well you'll see.*** end spoilers ***Last note:  Don't miss the end of the credits.  ;-) ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The characters are nowhere near as interesting or ambivalent as lets say in Game of Thrones, nor do the plot or the characters take any surprising twists or turns.I'd say it's popcorn fiction. The book does by no means come anywhere near R.R.Martin's books (Game of Thrones) or books written by William Gibson ... neither in complexity/atmosphere nor in their tendency to surprise.  But it is still fairly well written and an easy entertaining read and it has its good moments. Certainly suitable for most teenagers.  Essentially I'm sure, people who are fine with Harry Potter books, will like this one too.Also, if you saw the movie, there's still something for you in the book.  I saw the movie later and found many scenes in the movie which I would not have understood without the book. Naturally a few plot parts were missing from the movie too. So I imagine reading the book after the movie will still have some good moments.If you're still not sure if you should read it, click on the 1-star reviews and sort for most helpful first.

      "Corresponding review: I've purchased the dried apples from this company before and figured I would give the clusters a try.I appreciate the fact that this food id USDA organic, gluten free, corn free, and vegan. In fact, the ingredients are simple: organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch, organic cinnamon.In a 1/4 cup of these apple clusters, which remind me of rolled up oats ans/or hemp cereal, you receive 60 calories, with 0 calories from fat. There is no cholesterol, no protein, 1% of calcium, 2% of vitamin C, 2g of dietary fiber, 10 g of sugar, and 14 g of total carbohydrate.All in all, a healthy snack. The packaging makes it convenient for the on the go snack -- it is in a resealable 2.1 oz pouch (60 g), or four servings per package. Just enough to tantalize the senses, but not enough to pig out.The clusters are sugary bowls with a tint of cinnamon and a crunch reminiscent of cereal.Honestly, I prefer the taste of a real apple or the dried apples this brand sells at Starbucks, but in lieu of that, this is a good healthy snack alternative.Allergy alert: If you are extra sensitive, beware that this food is processed in a facility with nuts, dairy, wheat and soy.

It does not promise to be a whole-house security system with real time recording, etc. If you want that, look elsewhere and expect to pay more.But what you do get is a very good camera with high quality imaging that can be set up quickly and accessed by an easy to use app.I installed this camera in a matter of minutes on my home system (Mac based). The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite \"real time\" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera. It requires manual monitoring but unless you are willing to pay much more for a hard-drive based surveillance system, in this price range the D-Link camera is a very good option. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality.

      "Corresponding review: I tried the sister product, theTaco Bell Jalapeno Saucein August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's \"sauce,\" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its \"bold,\" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as \"bold.\"  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got \"bold\" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with \"tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.\"  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: \"Creamy\" this sauce is, but \"bold\" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American \"bold\" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

      "Corresponding review: At last, a massive epic/action/fantasy film that doesn't rest on special effects alone.  The most inspired aspect of this film is not the locations, digital effects or cinematogaphy...it's actually the CASTING. A truly INSPIRED element that, for me, has elevated the film into the hall of &quot;greatest adventure films of all time&quot;.Well done Peter Jackson for choosing actors none of us would have ever considered for the roles, and directing them in such a way where 'timing' of dialogue and movement makes the film come 'alive' with intensely 'human' effects.In fact, the casting is such a perfect match in every case, I cannot even imagine anyone else playing these marvellous characters.  Thankfully these films are all shot back to back so we're guaranteed the same cast throughout the trilogy.Especially Aragorn, Legolas, Boromir and Gandalf, who bring these roles to life in such passionate detail.  Each actor realizes the story is not just about good and evil, it is more about the sweet and righteous corruption of power.  The quality of these actors (most of whom come from the stage), allows them to illuminate this dark side of the rings (so omnipresent throughout the books), yet still maintain our sympathy and interest.  Especially those actors who play Boromir and Aragon: inspiring! Oops, now I'm repeating myself so I'll finish.This film deserves SIX STARS. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Oz the Great and Powerful(released Feb/13)stars,among others,James Franco,Mila Kunis,Rachel Weisz,Michelle Williams,Zach Braff,and Bill Cobbs.Walt Disney once again takes a crack at the Oz franchise and once again comes up short.It has a weak and meandering plot and an even weaker leading man.The story finds our wizard as a side show entertainer in a circus,who longs to be more than he is.He is a magician whose bag of tricks are getting very old,very fast.He is good with the ladies but does not want to be pinned down by any one in particular,even one who would like to marry him.One day the circus strongman comes after him and he hops aboard the circus balloon to save himself.However this results in his balloon getting sucked into a passing tornado.When he lands on the other side he is in the land of Oz.The first person he is greeted by is a good witch named Theadora.The two hit it off,as the wizard turns on the charm,and the two end up practically engaged;at least in Theadora's mind.When they reach the Emerald City,Theodora's sister Evanora is there waiting their arrival.His presence has alerted the entire kingdom and the prophecy of the returning wizard,they think,is apparently being fulfilled.Evanora tells him the kingdom is his to rule when he destroys the wicked witch who resides in the dark forest.The wizard leaves for the dark forest with a flying monkey called Finlay he met on the way to Oz,and along the way he picks up another traveling companion,a cute little china doll.When they reach their destination they find their quarry and plan to just steal her wand and break it.Their plans go awry and they come face to face with her.As it turns out it is Glinda,the good witch of the south.Evanora has tricked both the wizard and her own sister Theodora.Evannora,to retain an ally,shows her sister the goings on with Glinda through her crystal ball.It makes Theodora enraged.She gets so mad she takes a bite of an apple Evanora gives her,which turns her into a hideous green skinned evil witch.The wizard meanwhile has been introduced to a  variety of Oz inhabitants by Glinda,including Quadlings,Tinkerers and Munchkins.The wizard and Glinda concoct a plan to attack the Emerald City.The first attack is by robotic scarecrows through the poppy field.Glinda lays a low\"fog\"over the poppies to hide them and as the flying monkeys descend down to field level,they almost all fall asleep.However two grab and whisk away Glinda.The wizard now has to hatche a further plan to get Glinda back.He has a balloon float seemingly away from the city with the him aboard.The balloon is destroyed by Theodora,and the bait is taken.The wizard reappears courtesy of a holographic like projector with smoke,which he uses to intimidate the two witches.Theordora flies off on her broom,while Evanora flees into her castle.There she and Glinda have it out and Glinda defeats her,but Evanora is taken away by two flying monkeys.The film comes to its conclusion as the wizard presents his friends with gifts for their support and he takes Glinda behind his curtain for a romantic kiss.The leading character in a film like this, would have to have been played by someone with good acting skills,and with charisma and panache,as that is who this movie revolves around when all is said and done.Franco was terribly miscast.His acting is weak and he looks terribly uncomfortable in his role.This undermined,for me,the entire movie,despite all the good special effects this movie spewed forth.Any moment of pathos,drama or comedy were severally weakened by his inability to \"bring it\".He couldn't even come up to the level of his fellow players,and as a result dragged many of them down with him.As with many a Sam\"Evil Dead\"Raimi film,the director once again cast his old friend Bruce Campbell in a small supporting role.He is the guard at the gates of the Emerald City who gets hit on the head by Finlay(Mr.Campbell I'm sure could make much out of that!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role.Bruce Campbell could have given that character exactly what the role called for;a depth and humour Franco couldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.This film is kind of a prequel to the Oz books themselves,but it does mention characters like Quadlings,Winkies,and others that appear in the original books but have never been mentioned on film before.The film also has the odd salute to the /39 film.Watch as the wizard leaves the Emerald City.In the background in a field,is the\"horse of a different colour\".The best part of the film,I found,was the china doll character;CGI created at that.Technically speaking the film starts out in black and white,in a square box,center screen.Then when the wizard reaches Oz,the screen expands to a 2:40:1 a/r and colour.The picture was clear and crisp.As with many Disney one disc DVDs,there are no extras.All in all with a weak plot and an even weaker leading man,this film was doomed to fail.I couldn't get behind or believe Franco's role for one second.The special effects are good but it is not enough to make up for its other shortcomings.Barely three stars.

      "Corresponding review: Sixteen-year-old Jacob Portman, set to inherit a role in the family business, will never have to worry about a job or money. Of course, he has other problems&#8212;like uncool parents and almost no friends. Just before the grandfather who Jacob adores dies under mysterious circumstances, he leaves Jacob with a cryptic message about finding &#8220;The Bird.&#8221; Add this to incessant nightmares of monsters, and Jacob is soon sent to a psychiatrist. When Jacob decides he must go to a small island in the UK, Dr. Golan is supportive. Jacob&#8217;s father goes along to study the local birds. The story that Jacob begins to uncover becomes more and more complicated as he discovers that the silly stories people thought his grandfather made up were, in fact, real. And Jacob is not as boringly normal as he&#8217;s always thought.Ransom Riggs has written a very creative and entertaining story. His idea of spinning a tale based on peculiar old photographs is fresh and different. Jacob is a likeable protagonist.  The writing, particularly descriptions, is strong. There is a good bit of profanity, but it&#8217;s realistic for the way 16-year-old Americans talk among friends.As the story builds to its climax, I began to wonder if Riggs got a little hurried. One example, a European character who has spoken in rather formal 1940&#8217;s speech wants to find out who&#8217;s going to accompany her for something difficult. &#8220;Who&#8217;s in?&#8221; she asks, sounding like a current American. By the end, certain things seem to happen a little too easily, or be drawn out a little too long, and I was reading more rapidly. The ending come rather suddenly and leaves plenty of problems for Riggs and his characters to solve in the next book.Overall, a fun read for teens and many adults, too. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

You can't help but being engaged in the story as Katniss is catapulted into the hunger games arena; being swept along with her are a number of other characters who have varying degrees of involvement.This is my only problem really, in that the other characters feel quite undeveloped - i don't feel I know, or care about them very much. Having said this, I'm aware it is book one of a trilogy and expect the other characters to be developed for good and bad in the other two books, so I take this book as a great set-up for the trilogy and involving some really interesting themes both ancient and modern.

      "Corresponding review: A few months ago I read and really enjoyed Half-Blood by Jennifer L. Armentrout. So when I came across Obsidian it was no question about reading this book. Obsidian is a 'don't want to put down' book. I was hooked from the first sentence.Katy moves to a small town in West Virginia during the summer before her senior year. She's not too happy about the move but she loves and supports her mom's decision. Katy is also a book blogger. I must admit I was a little nervous when I read about that. However Jennifer L Armentrout pretty much nailed the blogger aspect of it. To satisfy her mom's request of not becoming antisocial,  she goes next door to meet the neighbors. What she doesn't expect is that the events that unfold after she knocks on their door will change her life forever.The characters in the book are great. I loved each and everyone of them. Katy is the main character. She's feisty, inquisitive and stands up for herself. Dee, Daemon's sister is delightful. She's the perfect best friend. Daemon is a jerk in the beginning. He's arrogant, overprotective, and drop dead gorgeous. Katy and Daemon have chemistry.  White hot chemistry.The story line in this book is very fast paced.  It's full of action, adventure and a little romance. There are secrets to uncover, enemies to out run and if all that's not bad enough they have to go tackle senior year. After I finished reading the last page I immediately wanted to read the next book in this series.  Jennifer L. Armentrout knows how to write a story! I want to live in her head with all these fantastic characters. I have high hopes for the next book in this series. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I have sampled various types of Starbucks flavored coffee over the years, and I have found that Starbucks coffee, no matter what the flavor, is usually very consistent.  Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee.

      "Corresponding review: OK let me start by saying I have studied antennas pretty extensively as a hobby. Living in Wisconsin, I am a die-hard Packers fan, and being a nursing student, cable is just too expensive for me. I started researching this antenna out of desperation because the antenna tower setup at my rental house is very outdated, and the cable connecting the antennas that are at the top of the 60ft tower is so thin, it looses an immense amount of signal. Anyway, I live about 36 miles from the Milwaukee towers, and about 50 from the Chicago towers. I already had the Antennacraft HBU33, which is an absolutely PHENOMENAL antenna if you are more then 40 miles from a tower (I have never used it for signals more the 50 miles away, so keep that in mind). This antenna (ANT751R, and make sure the \"R\" is at the end of the model number, as the model with the \"R\" is optimized for digital signal, as opposed to the older model which was more for analog signal) is designed for signals within the 40 mile range. I used my old antenna for Chicago stations, and bought this antenna for the Milwaukee stations. The setup works very well so far. I use both antennas with a signal combiner (a splitter that works both ways) and a RCA TVPRAMP1R for a pre-amp, and the picture so far is awesome. This antenna is so small, it seems like it would be ineffective, but WOW, its works like a champ! I will warn you that it does not pick up the lower VHF stations very well (2-6), so I had to modify it with coathangers to pick up those stations (Fox is channel 6 here, which a majority of Packer games are on). I did have to change the location of the antenna after not getting good reception on fox, even with adjustments with coathangers, to a higher place with fewer obstructions (the original place was clamped to the antenna tower as high as I could reach (which was about 10 ft up with a ladder), and was obstructed by the house next door, so your antenna may not have the low VHF issue, but I am not willing to take off my coathanger modification to find out if it works without it (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) in the new location. It is now on the roof of my porch, which is about 20 feet in the air. I also installed this antenna in the attic of my friend's 1 story house who is about 15 miles form the Milwaukee tower, and he reports perfect reception even without any sort of amp. Keep in mind that he was using a radio shack amplified set-top antenna before with a 15-20db amp built in, and on windy days, the reception would be choppy at best. He checked the reception on the day that the winds from hurricane Sandy were really bad in his area, and reported the signal was completely solid, so there you go. When installing this antenna, I would HIGHLY recommend using quad-shielded type f coax cable, to minimize signal loss. I would recommend purchasing the cable from monoprice, they were the lowest price when I installed my friend's antenna. Also, be careful with amplifiers, they can actually destroy your signal if your signal is already strong, so just keep that in mind. If you are at the very edge of the reception zone for this antenna, and your antenna is in a low place, or in your attic, then you may want to look into a pre-amp, otherwise, don't even bother.So to recap: This is a fantastic antenna that may not pick up the low VHF stations very well. I made a long loop with a coathanger and used hose clamps to attach them to the end of the VHF elements to get better low VHF signal, but that's just a suggestion. If you are putting the antenna up high, you may not have anything to worry about it. USE QUAD-SHIELDED TYPE F CABLE FOR YOUR SETUP TO MAXIMIZE GAIN AND MINIMIZE SIGNAL LOSS. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The black one was like Mocha. The inner tasted more like cheesecake which was great. But the yellow one was disappointing. I can't figure out what flavor it is.The washroom condition isn't really good.Overall a good place.Like to try the green tea cheesecake next time. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: build is very solid\n",
      "Human answer: the difference is not so obvious\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the difference?\n",
      "Corresponding review: After having used this lens for a few months and seeing the results it produces, it is easy to see why so many photographers wouldn't be without it.The build is very solid.  Ultrasonic motor and metal mount give the lens a very proffessional feel.  Granted, you can tell the difference between this lens and the much more expensive L version, but as far as picture quality goes, the difference is not so obvious.Bokeh you obtain with such a wide aperature is terrific for portraits, at aperatures from 1.4-2.0 there is some softness to the lens which gives portraits a bit of a \"dreamy\" look.  This is desired from many, but I don't particularly care for it.  Nevertheless, shots become extremely sharp after 2.0 and continue to improve to f 8.0.As far as whether you should purchase this particular lens or the less expensive 1.8 model, it really comes down to personal preference.  Budget is an important issue as you can get one for less than $90 and the other for around 330. The less expensive one has a plastic mount, which wont last as long, and it just feels less solid.  It also has a comparitavely loud and slower autofocus motor than the 1.4, and the focus ring is nearly non-existant.It took me a while to choose between the two, mainly because of the cost,  but finally decided on this one, I have not been dissapointed.

      "Corresponding review: A few reviewers previous to mine have stated that this isn't as good as many have insisted that it is.  On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capit&aacute;n Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capit&aacute;n Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capit&aacute;n Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi L&oacute;pez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd&uacute; plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled \"Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is \"boring.\"  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.  I will state in no qualified terms that I can't imagine any sophisticated film viewer not being completely astonished by this film.  I can state in complete honesty that this is the finest film of any kind that I have seen in many years. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: This is my second New Trent Airbender iPad case/keyboard combo. It is a very sturdy, elegant and functional Bluetooth keyboard case for your iPad Air. It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Air in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it&#8217;s pretty heavy, although not as heavy as the original version of Airbender. The case has been obviously redesigned, and it has lost some of its bulk. The new case doesn&#8217;t come with the several layers of protection for the iPad, which made it fairly hard to put your iPad in and out.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Air almost completely, except for the screen, which is now completely exposed. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Air from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use. The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is cramped, and it will really vary from one individual to the next how comfortable you find typing on a keyboard of this size. I am fine with composing emails and typing documents that are up to 500 words in length (such as this one), but I would not consider writing the next great American novel on it.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. The design of the arm and its attachment mechanism has also been tweaked from the previous model, and it&#8217;s now much easier to adjust it and keep the iPad fixed in its place. Both the landscape and the portrait modes are fully supported. The arm is detachable, and it allows you to position the keyboard at some distance from the iPad while typing &#8211; very convenient for the times when you don&#8217;t want to stare too closely at the small screen. When attached the are is very securely fixed and it allows you for the &#8220;true&#8221; laptop use anywhere where you feel like taking your iPad Air.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model. I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We stayed here over Labor Day for 3 nights in a deluxe queen room. The room wasn't huge but it was a good size for two people. The bed was a true queen size and very comfortable with nice bedding. The room was nicely decorated and had a medium size TV, a desk, 2 chairs, cd player with cd's, AC, and a small fridge. The room was very clean and housekeeping did a wonderful job cleaning everyday. We had our bedding and towels changed every day. Although you have the option of not having them changed everyday to save water (good idea!). They also have a turn down service and left yummy chocolates on our pillows. The bathroom has a small hairdryer and Aveda products. Our room didn't have much of a view but we didn't mind since we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The hotel staff was very friendly. We were allowed to check in early and they asked if we needed help with restaurant reservations or general information about SF. There are free maps and guidebooks in all tourist spots so no need to bring your own. The hotel also has free computer access and a room where you could either work or read. The restuarant is very small and didn't have a chance to eat there. I think there are less than 20 seats. So it's wise to make a reservation or arrive early. There was also a bar/lounge area. The elevator is fairly small and if there were other people waiting, we just took the stairs. The hotel is within walking distance from the BART station. Exit Powell and it's about ten minute walk. The fridge is fully stocked but like any other hotel, the prices are high. There is a Walgreens down the street from the hotel where you can stock up on water or snack. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. Some a bit expensive but it's expected as SF as a whole is expensive. There are 3 Starbucks coffee houses near the hotel. If you like to shop, the hotel is minutes from Union Square and is also within walking distance to Chinatown. We actually walked from Pier 39 and it didn't seem far at all. SF has reliable and efficient transportation that is fairly priced in case you don't want to walk. I don't recall the exact price for parking since we flew but most of the hotels charge from $40 and up per night. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel. I highly recommend it and would stay here again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: The mystery of Harriet 's disappearance was also very interesting\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the mystery like?\n",
      "Corresponding review: This is a book I almost gave up.  I listened to it on audio, and a few hours in I felt like I was still listening to background and set-up and was anxious for the story to get started.  Thankfully, once it got rolling it was a snowball I couldn't stop. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are very interesting characters... very alike in some ways, polar opposites in others.  I spent a great deal of time wondering how their stories would be tied together, and I wasn't disappointed when they eventually were. The mystery of Harriet's disappearance was also very interesting, and the whole story is nothing you would ever expect when the investigation begins. I just had a couple of problems with it... the author tends to refer to everyone by their last name, which is much harder for me to follow.  For some reason, I just don't remember last names as well as first names, so every time someone was mentioned that we hadn't heard of in a while, I had to think for a minute about who they were talking about.  Also, there's a bit of a loose end with the Harriet investigation that I was expecting to be tied up that never was. I was expecting a small twist that never came.Overall, I quite enjoyed this and look forward to reading the next two (assuming the third makes it through translation to English). The ending to this one was sad in a way I didn't expect, and I'm anxious to see what it means for Blomkvist and Salander. If you start reading this and struggle a bit through the beginning, just stick it out... It gets so much better! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Charlie's Angels is an insubstantial and entertaining dose of girl power. Although it will probably never be included in a list of 'alltime great films' it is nevertheless an enjoyable escape into a world where beautiful women kick-box their way out of danger, and manage to foil the bad guy's plans; all without smudging their makeup.Alex, Dylan and Natalie are an incredibly sexy crime-fighting trio, backed by an anonymous millionaire named Charlie. These Angels are the absolute epitome of cool. They can change from evening dress to street clothes in a matter of seconds, out-fight any number of evil henchmen, and disable a helicopter whilst hanging from the landing skids. And they manage to have a whole lot of laughs in the process; however if you're not a big fan of girlie giggles, this may start to grate after a while.The movie begins with a high-speed action sequence involving an attempted airplane hijacking which the Angels seemingly effortlessly manage to foil - this montage is perhaps emblematic of the rest of the film. The 'teamwork' motif is heavily emphasised, with the camera frequently (and occasionally annoyingly) cutting between the Angels whenever they're not in the same place at the same time. Visually stunning Matrix-style action sequences are peppered throughout the fast-paced script and these are well worth watching, even if only to marvel at how efficiently the fabulous trio of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz dispatch with the baddies whilst wearing designer clothing and high heels.Charlie's Angels is not a movie that is likely to alter lives or provoke deep thought, but instead it can be enjoyed purely as fun escapism. And after all, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about? ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

HuluPlus and Amazon on Demand seem to have packet streaming that deals with that pretty well--I have to restart movies during peak hours, two or three times, but other than that I don't have much interruption.But, I thought this didn't work at all with a two-year-old Dell laptop because it couldn't connect during peak hours.

      "Corresponding review: If you enjoy &quot;old school&quot; service and city elegance, you will love the Omni San Francisco. The decor is elegant and the service friendly and impeccable. From the moment we arrived, everyone on staff bent over backwards to accommodate every request and everyone down to the maintance guy in the hall had a cheerful greeting for you. The concierge, Lex ,was incredibley helpful. The room was well-appointed and the bed with crisp sheets and duvet very comfortable. Sign up for Omni' frequent stay program and enjoy benefits on your first stay including complimentary beverage (you can choose both coffee and juice/bottled water per person) and choice of newspaper delivered each morning at the time you choose. Yes - the bar and restaurant are on the expensive to the OMG side - especially if you dive into the steak menu at dinner ($54 for a veal chop - wow!) but have to say I had a wonderful burger in the bar one night and did not begrudge the $19 price tag because it was so good. Breakfast was also pricey (and not as outstanding) but you can add pastries, fruit and even a breakfast sandwich on to your complimentary breakfast beverage order for not too big a hit so we went that route and enjoyed a more affordable breakfast in our room. As for location, you cannot beat this spot for convenience to the Ferry Building, Union Square, China Town and all other points. Buy a three-day pass ($18) from the front desk and you can ride the trolley (stops right in front of the hotel), the vintage buses and regular buses to your hearts content. Also, if you plan to go to the Tut exhibit, ask the concierge if they have any leftover VIP passes. They cost a few bucks more but you can go whenever you want and bypass the long line by using the VIP line once inside the museum - you just have to promise the concierge that you will be discreet and not a big blowhard about having a VIP pass.....

      "Corresponding review: Wow, this was bad. I'd been hearing about how fantastic this book was from co-workers so I was really excited to read it. I almost purchased it, but I decided to wait for it from the library. Thank Goodness!The story starts off very slowly with the narration from a dull 17 year old. It drags on about how she hates her life in the new town, blah, blah. Then to she becomes obsessed with the mysterious abnormally attractive dude. She notices some strange things about him. This part, after we stop hearing about Bella's family life and before she gets to know Edward is the best part of the book. After she discovers his secret and they become closer the story just drowns on. Its just filler until the silly ending because how many different ways can they say I love you? How many times do we have to hear Bella whinning about being ordinary and Ed exclaiming she's perfect? HOW MANY TIMES CAN BELLA BABBLE ON ABOUT HOW PERFECT EDWARD IS?? BLAH, BLAH!!!!!I read the second book because I got it from the library at the same time. I didnt have a desire to read it after I finished Twilight and had to force myself, it was only marginally better. I have no desire to read the last 2.I cant understand how grown women actually like this trite drivel, I'll be giving my co-workers a firm talking to when I see them. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: To go up the CN Tower, you can either pay thirty something dollars for the elevator ride OR you can choose to dine at the 360 restaurant (Keep in mind you have to spend a minimum amount for each person since you didn't pay for the lift tickets: i.e. you can't come up for free and just get a small dessert, you got to order a proper meal).   We got the $75 Prix-fixe. This choice is a step up from the first Prix-Fixe option which is $65 per person. The reason we went for the $75 Prix-Fixe was because we just liked the appetizer and main menu options better than the other one. They also serve you a small pre-appetizer dish, which so very small, but delicious nonetheless. We tried the Sesame Albacore Tuna and liked it a lot. For the appetizer, I got the clam chowder and my girlfriend tried the smoked salmon appetizer, both were good. For main, we both got sirloin steak, I got mine medium, and she got hers medium well. The steaks were both seasoned very well and very good , mine was nice , moist and juicy, hers however was a bit on the dry side. After trying my steak she wished she had gotten a medium steak as well! For dessert we both got the Dark Chocolate Tower with sour cherries. The dessert really wasn't as good as we thought it would be. It was kind of plain, not chocolaty enough , not really as sweet as other dark chocolate cakes we are used to, but someone who likes their dessert less sweet might like this cake, the two of us not so much. In the end, we spent about 2 hours in the dining area, we  enjoyed our meal and especially the 360 degree view which was super nice, and then we spent about an hour at the look out area up stairs.The Service was excellent; out server was very personable and quite  knowledgeable and gave us a lot of info about the history of restaurant and answered our random questions about the  different parts of city we could see from up there! Overall, the food was pretty good, price sort of high but you get a pretty amazing view and the food covers the lift tickets, I won't be coming here everyday, but if I have a visitor from out of town, or for special occasions, I think I'll be returning.

      "Human answer: It is a very full toned and haunting picture\n",
      "Corresponding question: What does the movie have?\n",
      "Corresponding review: \"Brokeback Mountain\" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of \"Titanic\" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing. I am certain that this picture is very Oscar-worthy.I saw this movie about a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture. To say that it was the very best film that I have ever seen would simply trivialize it, because it is much more than just a movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The bathrooms are clean and the towels are plush. The location is great because you are right in the middle of everything and can get to many of the tourist attractions by bus or even just walking. The pool and patio are excellent. The pool is heated and a great size for anyone with small children. The patio is spacious and has lots of places to sit from picnic tables to grass and all the lounge chairs in between. The room service is very nice.

      "Corresponding review: No doubt this place is beautiful. Located in the heart of King West, Patria is both fun and sophisticated, and a great environment for group dinners or dates. Definitely upscale, but not so much that the environment is uptight and constricting. It's just the right amount of class and liveliness. Intricate designs on the walls, carefully planned lighting, tasteful and trendy furniture and decor - I really enjoyed the setting.First, the parking situation. We found parking for $6.00 on a Friday evening in a parking garage at King Street and Spadina Avenue, just east of the restaurant. Second, the service. Super friendly, pleasant, and honest. Our waiter even stopped us from ordering more food, letting us know when we ordered too much (his recommendations were on point - we ordered just enough).Third, while the environment and the service were excellent, the food was just alright. We ordered: a) jamon serrano, b) meatballs, c) bacon covered dates, d) empanadas, e) chicken paella, and f) a glass of red sangria, To be honest, I couldn't hold down the bacon wrapped dates (I don't enjoy dates to begin with, so this was definitely not for me). The jammon serrano (aged for 24 months) was just fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the empanadas and meatballs - while it tasted fine enough, we've definitely had better elsewhere. The chicken paella was the best item out of everything we had, full of flavour and texture. Definitely try this if you're here for dinner.Overall, we'd come back here for a group dinner or to start off a fun evening, but we wouldn't come back for the food or if tasty food was our priority. On the whole, Patria isn't bad, but it's not the best. Also, we weren't too hungry to begin with, so we were fine with portion size, but if you are coming super hungry, note that there's a good chance you'll find portion size a bit small. For our entire order, with tax, and tip, our total came to around $120. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The plot was intriguing and moved along nicely; the characters were solidly depicted.I grew up in a machine shop, and appreciated some of the details that were included. For example, when Jules adds an air hose to a helmet she describes how she used the tap to create the thread. I've done that hundreds of times and this made her actions more realistic. Details like this would probably be overlooked in a movie.I am a software developer by profession, so the idea of IT was familiar. However, in Wool the IT function was more political and media-control than \"IT\". That's Okay.After finishing the book I thought about how \"complete\" the story was. It's like a miniature world history of people we can relate to (to some extent...) placed in a \"smaller world\" and living under different rules (\"religion\"). Whether the author intended to or not, the story touches on survival, political, military, media manipulation and environmental issues. Makes you (or at least me...) think!Great job, Hugh!

      "Corresponding review: I finally had the opportunity to try Byblos after struggling to secure a reservation on a weekend a number of times. Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try.

      "Corresponding review: Visited the Holiday Inn Express 4/24 - 4/28. Overall, we were happy with the hotel. The location was perfect for us - close to the wharf and local transit. The hotel itself is very nice looking with a modern decor. Our room, single king bed, was more than adequate. Maid service was good. The breakfast was decent for a hotel complimentery breakfast. There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4.There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little &quot;extras&quot;. I thought it would have been nice to have coffee/tea service in the lobby area throughout the day, not just until 9:30 am - we've had this at other Holiday Inn Express hotels and basic type hotels such as Quality Inns, etc. Some aspects of service could have been a little better as well. I wanted to have a tea in my room early one evening. I had forgot to take a milk back up to the room in the morning - tea with powdered whitener just isn't that great. I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their &quot;house man&quot; was not on duty. While I was waiting at the front desk an older man approached and indicated that they had just returned from their day out and their room hadn't been cleaned. The gentleman at the front desk indicated that he &quot;couldn't understand how that could happen, it had never happened before&quot;. He asked the guest if he was sure he didn't leave his Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The guest replied he was sure he hadn't. The front desk clerk then proceeded to tell the gentlemant there was nothing he could for him as the cleaning staff were gone for the day and again, the house man was not in. The front desk clerk didn't offer anything to the guest for the inconvenience - he just restated he couldn't understand how that could happen. To me, surely someone could have gone up and emptied the garbages and at least gave them clean towels? Also, don't forget that parking is very expensive, as is pretty standard with wharf area hotels. We didn't have a vechicle but noticed that the valet parking was over $40 per night. If we returned to SF, we wouldn't have any hesitation staying at this hotel again as any issues we had were really quite minor. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: We recently stayed at King George for 2 nights and had a great time.  The room we had (Superior Room, 1 Queen Bed) was definitely not the biggest hotel room as we read in some reviews, but we did not plan on spending a ton of time in the room anyways.  There was definitely enough space for what you need (small walk-in and lots of storage under the bed).  The bed was honestly one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in!    Bathroom was tiny but again, all you need and very clean.  Our room was ready when we arrived in San Fran around 11am which was awesome and staff was great. Location wise, it is right by everything you need (transit, restaurants and shopping).  There are homeless people honestly anywhere you go in San Fran - one street is good then another is a tad shady.  We were not bothered by any of them right by the hotel.  A minor downside to the hotel is the elevator.  As the hotel has an older feel which I really liked, the elevator is quite tiny and very slow which can be a negative if you have a big group or lots of luggage or are older.  The stairs are very narrow and windy which gave us an added leg workout along with walking around San Fran!  We would stay here again and recommend it to someone looking for a hotel.     Nice staff, amazingly comfortable bed, clean room, very quick check-in and check-out, great location.   Great location.  It is right by transit, great restaurants and lots of shopping.   More variety at the lounge (it is just wine and beer), elevator upgrade. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the bar?\n",
      "Corresponding review: If I could describe these bars in one word it would be: meaty. Yes, because they're big, thick and filling.  They have really big peanuty taste and the nuts on top are large and plentifulThey remind me of another granola bar, the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut bars. Those too are coated with peanut butter and have big peanuts on top. These bars are very similar to those and to be honest, I really couldn't find a difference between the two. One pro I did find was that the peanut butter coating did not start melting while eating. I did not find myself needing to get a napkin to wipe sticky fingers.While these bars are filling, it's also due to high calories and fat. This would scare someone from eating this as a snack everyday but they are good for a meal replacement if you're busy and can't take a break for lunch. In fact, one bar is much more filling than eating a Slim Fast meal replacement bar.Overall, I did enjoy these bars. They are tasty, filling and portable to carry around.  If possible share with a friend, for maximum enjoyment. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Ahhhh, melt in your mouth goodness. I LOVE the caramel chocolate combo!The problem with caramel chocolate bars is they are incredibly messy. The caramel oozes out in a deliciously messy goo. Great for the tastebuds, not so great for clothing. This treat totally eliminates the messy gooey ooze from such a treat.The chocolates are perfect for a dainty nibble, or just the right size to pop in all at once. Depending on your chocolate ingestion style. I'm a popper myself. No dainty nibbling here. Wrapped individually, these are wonderful to share with coworkers, or hide them all for yourself. They are wrapped in an attractive gold foil, perfect to set out in candy dishes. Generally, I'm a sharer. BUT, I have to admit, I didn't share these. Perhaps when I make my next purchase of them. Which I WILL do :)I'm hoping they make other flavors as well, I sampled the Original Caramel chocolates. I'm wondering if they make a dark chocolate version as well, because I do prefer dark over milk chocolate.The mix of caramel and chocolate was just right. The balance of the two was PERFECT.

      "Corresponding review: As an all out Zune owner, I have always enjoyed the devices and how they would update their devices with all the new features every year, including the old brick zunes. Since they weren't going to do it this time, I knew it was time to upgrade. I got a 32gb HD with no hesitation, there are a couple of things that you need to know about if you really want this compared to the Apple Ipod Touch.What I think is the best part about the Zune HD is its beautiful OLED screen. You don't know how beautiful a video or picture can look on a small device until you look at it on the Zune HD. The black quality on the screen is amazing and the colors are so vivid. Some of the features on the device is really helped out by the beautiful screen that this device possesses.Graphics: With a stripped down version of the nVidia Tegra chip inside the device, you can not go wrong. It has 8 processors making the device working at its best. It will definitely help once 3D games come to the device. Can't wait for that to happen!!!Software and Marketplace: The Zune software is...nice, could be better, could be worse. I like that it is customizable unlike Itunes. The marketplace is pretty, it could definitely have more videos and movies, but lets not forget that they just started with movies when the Zune HD came out. Still, many of the TV shows that I have like watching on CBS and FOX are NOT on the Zune Marketplace, which disappoints me. This can be apart of the review because this is the only software that the Zune is compatible with. Yes, its only on PC, its so sad that people with Macs can't use it, that 5-10% that can just use boot camp to use it. I mean seriously Mac users, get over it, YOU CAN USE IT!!! I have always like the wireless sync feature just in case I just don't want to find my sync cord you can just bring up the software and on the device just click wireless sync. Podcasts are handled on the Zune software. The catalog of podcasts are not as big on Itunes, but that is not such a big deal. What is great about it is that you can choose how many that you want to keep on your computer, so it automatically deletes on the ones that get old or outdated. You can also choose which ones to automatically sync to the device. Whether it be all of them, or just the ones that haven't been played yet and the ones that get played on the device get deleted after you watch.Apps: No store here. People who want a device for apps, its not here. The Zune HD has a very few simple games and only 2 applications. Microsoft has promised that they will be adding more to the catalog eventually, but its not here. The games and apps that they already for the device are nice to have. I always the Texas Hold 'Em game, simple but nice. The newest update allows 3D gaming which is great. Audiosurf Tilt is simply amazing with the screen. They are all free, thats a plus, but the catch is there are short advertisements before the games come up. Thats not such a big deal if you can get all of their stuff for free. I would much rather, though, pay for a valuable app from other developers. Microsoft has to keep with the times and allow other developers to create their own apps. Once Microsoft actually reads something from their reviewers and listens to them, they might get somewhere even further.UI: Beautiful, Microsoft was really working to create an interface for a touch device. They did a beautiful job at doing so. The searching for media on the device is so easy and very quick to learn. I absolutely LOVE the sidebar on the main screen. You just click on the left side of the main screen and this other screen comes up with \"Pins\", which are basically songs, pics, or videos that you like you can pin to the side bar so you can quickly access that when you turn it on. The next feature on that screen is history, which shows everything that you have been doing on the device like songs that you just recently listened to, podcasts, or websites that you view on the web browser. The last feature on that screen is \"New\" which shows the newest things that you recently added to the device so if you just added a song to the device, just go to the history screen and you can easily play the song without going through any menus. You can also delete ANYTHING that you want off your device by just clicking on the item. I know that the Ipod Touch does this, just not with everything.Music and features: Sound playback has always been the best on the Zune. They decided to bring the basic EQ back to the device, which is nice...just not nice enough. A customizable EQ would be great. You don't even need an EQ if you have the Zune premium headphones, with both of them together, it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)! I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month. So if you compare it to Itunes...10 songs for $1.29, you spend $13 on 10 songs that you get to keep and that means you get unlimited streaming to millions of songs for just $2 a month. What a bargain!!! You also get the the Zune Pass with the On-device marketplace. You can download songs to the device right from the online device marketplace and even when you get offline, you can still continue listening to it. I love the zune pass and its definitely worth it if you love music.On-Device Markeplace - Very nice to have, especially if you have the Zune Pass. They also have the very few apps on the marketplace and you can download updates right from the marketplace, but there hasn't been any updates to the 7 games that Microsoft supplies.Pictures: Beautiful, scrolling to the next picture and rendering the picture from horizontal to landscape takes not time. It uses the same multi-touch feature to zoom and is quite useful. Overall...nice.Radio: This is one of Microsoft's selling points. This radio is FM AND HD radio. Too bad I don't live near any main radio station that include HD radio stations. I don't really see any improvements in the radio either. When I go to the city, I will let you guys know. What I have always loved about the radio is the tag to FM feature, which is when you get a clear enough reception, it will show the title of the radio station and the song that is playing currently. You can tag that song and add it to your cart which you can download with the marketplace. That is a great way to get introduced and familiar with new music.Social: Still evolving...not there yet. I am so sad that they took away the song and podcast sharing from zune to zune wirelessly. Its gone, now there is a way to send songs with an email address or zune tag (or xbox live gamertag) when you plug your zune back into the computer. What they did do is add your zune inbox if your account is synced with your device, and it displays on your device...which is nice. But it is still sad that they took away the wireless song sharing feature. (It still works with the older models if you still have one!)Internet browser: OK...not as good as the Ipod Touch safari browser. There is no flash...yet. But you get the choice to either use the internet browser as a mobile browser or you can view sites in their desktop format, its a choice in the internet settings menu. The keyboard is small, but isn't every PMP keyboard? The added auto-correct features with the new firmware update, but it is still not as good as safari.This was a complete and honest review. I love Zune and I have always thought about going back to Ipod, but Zune keeps coming out with new devices that can not be refused. Music and video playback and exploration...Zune is the one and only way to go. No other device does it as good as Zune. Applications and web browsing are better for the Ipod people. Unlimited streaming of music and keeping 10 songs a month, go Zune. Paying individual songs at $1.29 a month to keep forever, go with Ipod. There are so many things that I listed on here and probably a couple of other things that would affect your decision. But I hope that this helped.5/17 update...1. the newest zune update got rid of all of the advertisements before the apps started2. There are now around 20 apps for the HD including facebook and twitter...still nothing special. Let's just hope the the Windows 7 series phones apps will be compatible.3. CBS and FOX have both been added to the Zune Marketplace4. They have added the Smart DJ feature to the HD device (like Genius on the ipod, but actually gets better results)5. Direct Xvid compatibility...you don't know how much better that made this thing. Makes the Zune way more compatible that now you can directly add .avi files without converting first.6. Internet browser got better, faster tilt sensitivity and faster overall experience. You can take snapshots of what is on the screen while surfing and save it to the device in pictures.

However, truth be told, there are a lot scarier and a lot better made movies out there that you could be seeing.  Yes, this is an okay movie. It got a lot of hype because of it's  &quot;inventive&quot; documentary style (this has been used before, see  some cult horror movies). It got too much hype, so much that the final  product couldn't live up to it, especially if you're seeing it now.While  Blair Witch does have some genuinely scary moments, they are precious few.  I kept getting the feeling that the film's style was just a gimmick rather  than an actual attempt at making it look like a documentary. There is one  thing in this movie that does stand out though - the performances. They are  not that amazing, but compared to a lot of today's horror movies they are  quite good. Heather is impressive, and Michael and Josh are good too.To  close: rent Blair Witch, but don't buy it. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Parking was $35 per night, but what can you do. The main lobby was very nice, but we got stuck in the building next door, which I believe is where all the riff-raff with AAA discounts are condemned. There is no parking there, except for around 10 spots near the main entrance which were constantly full. So, you have to double park, drop off the luggage, then drive back to the posh hotel to park. Then you repeat the process when you leave. The &quot;annex&quot; is barren, except for the Denny's, which was crowded (not sure why with so much great food around). The rooms were adequate and clean. We only got 3 bath towels for the 4 of us, and it took over an hour on two consecutive nights to get a 4th. Our view was of the tourists in the next wing of the annex. We would stay again only for the location, but try to get a room in the main building. Maybe things are nicer there. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Human answer: Some of these teas were black teas , while others were green teas\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is this tea compared to other ones?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I have never heard of a savory tea, so when I heard these, my curiousity was in full set. Instead of thinking of these as a tea, think of it as a sipping broth. These teas would make great soup broths or a simmering liquid.  Some of these teas were black teas, while others were green teas. Here are my thoughts on each of the six flavors:Fennel Spice (Green Tea) - This is the first flavor I tried. Fennel tastes reminiscent of licorice, so I thought it would be a safe try. After brewing this tea, I was a little hesistant to try it. It had a strong earthy scent, and I thought it would be too strong. Luckily, the taste of the tea was not earthy, but it was pleasant fennel taste (as one would expect). This tea would make a great base for a vegetable soup, but this one works well on its own too. My main complaint is just the smell. - 4/5 starsBeet Cabbage (Black Tea) - This one has a rich vibrant red color. The first thing that hit me with this tea was again, the smell. I shouldn't be surprised though, as cabbage has a notoriously strong scent. The scent was so bad, that I was tempted on to try the tea instead. Instead, I took a few small sips. This tea tastes the way it smells. I couldn't really taste beet, but I definitely tasted the cabbage. - 1/5 starsSpinach Chive (Green Tea) - Another horrible smell. At this point, I've decided that all of these will not have pleasant smell. It's not like vegetables are known for their wonderful smell. This one tasted okay. The spinach and chive was well balanced, but I'm not sure this would be a good tea to drink on its own, as it is a strong taste. - 3/5 starsTomato Mint (Black Tea) - Surprisingly, this one had a pleasant smell (just when I cad come to accept that these teas would not smell good). It smells like fresh mint and tomatoes, and I mean fresh, not like canned tomato or mint flavoring. I'm a huge fan of mint, and I like tomato soups/juices as well, but I've never had them together. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. The mint came off like tasting like toothpaste, and I couldn't get pass that. The tomato flavor was okay, but it was overshadowed by the mint. - 1/5 starsCarrot Curry (Green Tea) - I enjoyed this tea. Along with the carrot, this one has ginger as well. Like fennel spice, this one can standalone as well. - 4/5Broccoli Cilantro (Green Tea) - This one reminded me of the spinach chive tea. The cilantro adds a bit of zing. Like the spinach chive one, this is probably a bit too strong to drink alone. - 3/5 starsMost of these teas are passable, but my favorites were fennel spice and carrot curry. Averaging the ratings, I get about 2 2/3 stars, so I rounded it up to three. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Affordable, casual, and tasty. MeNami has tasteful decor, a clean menu, but isn't particularly special. I had an unfortunate experience with the service, but the food as alright.Our server was a Caucasian lady who seemed extremely anxious and distraught. She arrived at our table to ask if we were ready to order, and then sped away after we told her we weren't ready. It took a while to get her attention after that, and she appeared to be extremely stressed and unhappy. There were two servers on the floor, and it's not an overly large restaurant, so I was a little perplexed that she was so stressed. We didn't get a single smile or cheerful remark which irked me a little. Sure, she's busy and/or new to the job. But the job of the waiter is to make the customer feel welcome... which was not accomplished. Moving on to the food... We ordered the corn kaki-age, which was delicious. Deep fried corn clusters that had good texture and just the right amount of crunch. Chicken Karaage was next, and I enjoyed the fried chicken. Juicy, hot, and not too much batter. A good go-to appetizer.Kama Udon - Just your basic Kitsune Udon with two fish cakes. Not much to say here. The broth was alright but not spectacular. Spicy Pork Udon - More like a kimchi udon with pork. Average, but the fact that the kimchi taste gets old and tiring after a million bites is a downside. Not much variety to this dish.

      "Corresponding question: Where is battery ?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Pros: Beautifully designed and built. From the perforated look rubberized area where your thumb rests to the brushed metal strips which arcs gracefully around the side of the mouse, to the low gloss plastic finish and the metal scroller wheel with rubber insert, it's a beautiful mouse, high quality mouse.It's extremely comfortable as well. Perhaps not quite as much as my old MX Revolution, but very close.Darkfield is extremely precise and works on every surface I've tried, from my shirt to my glass desk.This is the Cadillac CTS-V of mice.Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit, a nice feature since internal battery failure caused the death of my MX Revolution.Charging is done via USB cable, so no down time.Battery life on its first full day of use is excellent, still 3 bars after hours of use.Have a middle mouse button again! Now shifting between the wheel modes is done via dedicated button.Nifty little travel casePlenty of programmablity.Cons: Cons are only a few.Forward/back/zoom buttons don't quite fall into reach as naturally as they did on the MX Revolution.Loss of shift-to-click. I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.Hopefully it will last! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I recently dined here for a birthday dinner with a few other individuals. It had been quite some time since I had visited this particular location and overall not much had changed in terms of the ambiance, the service or even the menu.For a Monday night, it was surprisingly busy; however, not busy enough to justify the inattentive service. We had multiple servers and when we would attempt to ask one to come to the table for service, we were told that another server would come around. Furthermore, the tables are so close together it feels like you're invading your neighbours' party!Our meals consisted of: The Verde salad which was overdressed and a tad soggy, the Margherita pizza (which we asked to be sliced for the birthday girl, but apparently slicing it ruins the authenticity), the Salmon which was actually quite a good portion with a salad on the side, and the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was thoroughly enjoyed! We were not offered any daily food or drink specials. There were a few dietary concerns from guests and when the server was asked to clarify whether these would be a part of the meal, she did not return. In fact, the meal was presented to the guest before even making us aware of if the ingredient of concern would be included.Additionally, there were significant delays after we were finished with dinner and asked for the dessert menu; and when she finally arrived to take our order, we had been waiting for an additional 30 mins after completing the meal. Furthermore, when the dessert finally arrived for our birthday girl with a lit candle, it wasn't the dessert she ordered!Overall, the experience was 'pleasant' and our birthday girl enjoyed her night, which was the most important thing! I wish that I could say that my dining experiences at the other locations have been better, but the issues of inattentive service, little changes in the menu or consideration of dietary concerns has been consistent.I can't say that I would be eager to return.

      "Corresponding review: The idea is good, but the execution is pretty bad.Pros: the only popular option for Amazon Instant Video.  The box is small.  Seems to have more content to offer than competitors.Cons:1. No audio volume control.  Imagine you open some Amazon instant video and the volume is too loud, the only solution is to grab the other remote.  Notice this is not a cheap remote, which embeds some kind of motion sensor.  Some reviews defend this by saying something like no way to control the volume over hdmi or the box is not responsible for the audio, a joke.2. Sometimes when playing Amazon video the box would not response to the remote, which means you cannot pause or skip when you want to.  I gusss the bluetooth connection is lost.  Whatever the reason is, a bug.3. Must have a credit card to set up the box and account, in the name to make it easier for you to purchase something.  How come?4. No way to turn the box off.  To me, this means I have to use the other remote the turn my TV off.5. No support of youtube.  The unofficial one has been off the limits of new customers for half a year.  Maybe the new guys they hire need tons of time to read the source code.6. The user interface leaves a lot to improve.  When I was trying to input something in the search box, I would guess a remote with qwert keyboard or some convenient way to input characters will make the majority miserable.  By the way, if you have many channels, do not get tired when scrolling the main menu, as there is no way to sort out your channels.7.In short, this is not product designed for normal users.Buy a tv that supports netflix, Amazon video and youtube.

I had to stain the tea because, despite the package instructions, I found it to be too gritty and twiggy when just mixed into water.  Even after staining, just looking into the drink shows lots of bits and pieces but NOW I do not taste or feel them as I drink it. It's like drinking a really dark roast or real expresso cup of coffee but it's really tea.  I've never had this type of tea before but I find it rather interesting and tasty.  Since it has no caffeine, I will be able to drink this after dinner without worries of being kept awake.  I love the fact that it is loaded with antioxidants!  I wish I could find the words to describe the flavor but if you like really strong dark tea, you'll like this one.  I recommend this strong flavored tea! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Rofl! Lol! Lmao! I could not stop laughing out loud (seriously) with this one. Ms. Clayton has a wicked, wicked sense of humour. Please buy it. I guarantee you will not regret it.Wallbanger was a nice cross between chick lit and NA but with none of the conflict and angst that you see in a lot of NA books of late. To be perfectly honest, I was getting tired of all the sobbing, helpless virgins. This book, however, was a very realistic take on relationships in the 21st century. Both protagonists have successful and fulfilling careers, and great friends. Oh and let's not forget Clive. :) I loved it and am looking forward to the next book (Rusty Nailed) which is all about Simon and Caroline settling into a relationship.The Wallbanger and Pink Nightie Girl start off as neighbours, then friends, and then inevitably, lovers. SPOILER ALERT-During their friendship phase there is plenty of sizzling heat and tension but no sexy times until 70% into the book. For those of you who love plenty of sexy times, this one may not be for you. That being said, once these two start they.... Do. Not. Stop. As in like rabbits, people!Yes, Caroline talking about her O, LC, Brain, and Heart did get a little annoying but definitely not anywhere close to getting me to give up on the story.The secondary characters were great.

      "Corresponding review: Don't want to make this seem a self serving review but I need to say it.  I was not a fantasy reader before I came across A Game of Thrones.  Closest things to it I read were some of Stephen King's horror-fantasy stuff, Harry Potter and Terry Pratchett's half-fantasy, half-satire Discworld series.  I remember finishing the latter, and looking for something a little more...serious.  Saw reviews for George R.R. Martin praising him, decided it couldn't hurt to give fantasy a shot, and picked up Game of Thrones.I read it in one sitting.  Seriously.  Since then I've read it again and again.  I recommend it to anyone who will listen to me.  Several have, and are now just as big of fans of Martin's series as I am.It's because of this book I love fantasy.  Because I tore through the first four books and wanted a fantasy fix while waiting for A Dance with Dragons, I got to discover Robert Jordan, Tad Williams, Scott Lynch, Joe Abercrombie, and Steven Erikson.But still, none of them top Martin and his Song of Ice and Fire series.  And A Game of Thrones is arguably one of the best books in the series.Why?  So many reasons.  Martin is simply a gifted writer, who grabs your attention and is great at both description and characterization.  He somehow makes EVERY character, no matter how big or small, captivating.  I was sucked into the lives of the citizens of  Westeros and its environs and never looked back.The plot is unpredictable and features huge twists.  What makes them great is they don't seem to be twists for the sake of shock value, but are deliberate and calculated on Martin's part.  When something big happens, you see the impact it has on the characters and the world.The story is told in point of view format, mostly from the perspective of members of the Stark family but also of Tyrion, an enigmatic member of the Lannisters, the Starks' rivals, and Dany, an exiled member of the former Westeros ruling dynasty both the Starks and Lannisters helped overthrow who is now with her brother in a distant desert region.  Won't say more than that.  While every reader will have their favorites and those who they may just groan at when they see their name, every character is well realized and even the 'boring' ones have their moments of awesomeness.The writing. The story and the sheer scope of the story.  The characters.  Hell, everything.  That's why this book is a great recommendation to anyone.  Add the fact that as far as fantasy goes, there aren't even that many fantastical aspects to it, and you'll be able to lure even the most leery skeptic in. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: There was so much hype about this novel, I was anxious to read it. I had not read anything by this author so didn't know what to expect. However, I was not disappointed.The characters are strong, the descriptions of the Museum of Modern Art and various paintings, New York City, Las Vegas, and Amsterdam are vivid, and the sad life of a motherless boy are enough to recommend this book.The first 550 pages are so well-written that I didn't want to put the book down. But  I did put it down, then picked up it up and it seemed as though I had never stopped! I would have given this novel 5 Stars, but after the first 550 pages, the plot got weaker and slower and stayed that way until the end.It's obvious Ms. Tartt put lots of research into her novel and she is to be commended. I will definitely read other books by her. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Canoe is one of the most coveted licious venues, so I was very glad to have been able to get a lunch reservation for Winterlicious of 2011. Now I realise that a lot of people say this is not worth the hype, and that might be true if you lay down a lot of money and not end up with a seat next to a window etc. While my group did not get a window table, our meal was still very nicely done with very attentive and friendly service. Even though this is a 3 star review, I was not unhappy with my overall dining experience, the food however was not as amazing as I expected.My heart was broken a little when my rabbit entrée came out looking very rabbit-leg like and matters were not made better when it didn't have a lot of flavour in it either, served with a rather measly portion of veggies. But my appetizer and dessert dishes were very well done. Unfortunately the weather was not being nice to us and all we could see out the window were low hanging clouds and the occasional glimpse of neighbouring buildings. My sense of direction was totally blown when the side I thought was North turned out a view of the City Centre Airport during a break in the clouds. Would very much like to return on a nice clear day. Our server was friendly and did not at all give us a rushed feeling despite it being the peak lunch time. Depending on what's on the menu I would most definitely give Canoe a return visit! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: If the restaurant was more spacious and less noisy, I would give this place 5 stars. First of all, if you are expecting a restaurant that is going to bring you giant, over-sized platters of food with sides like fries and cesar salads, go to Montana's and save your money. Lee is not that type of place. This is gastronomy at its finest, and Susur Lee is an internationally known chef that we are fortunate enough to have in Toronto. People who whine about small portions and price and claim the food sucks are absolutely clueless and clearly not familiar with what upscale restaurants like Lee has to offer. Like most I had the Singapore Slaw, which is beyond delicious. I dream about that salad and it has been a while since I have been to Lee. Spectacular. Incredible. Worth every penny. Drinks are incredible so splurge and order a cocktail because it will be unlike anything you have ever tasted before. This place is not a fast food restaurant, your drinks will take some time, maybe longer than your food so relax and get patient. We ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and then dessert, which was enough food for everyone. If you have a food allergy be sure to tell them and they will protect you. I am allergic to shellfish which is very unfortunate in a restaurant like this, but they ensured my food was safe and offered alternative suggestions. If you want to have an excellent dining experience, including tax and tip I would budget about $100 per person. If you like more than 1 cocktail or want to do the suggested wine pairings with each course then you will need a lot more money. It is worth the money if you can afford it. This is not a restaurant you will go to all the time, it is a special occasion and a place you could go once a year and splurge. Everyone should experience the genius of Susur Lee at least once in their life! This is NOT a child friendly restaurant AT ALL. Get a babysitter and leave the kids at home. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Have you ever come across a book that is so powerful and so touching you know from the very beginning that it is going to pull you in and keep you there until the very end?  It will keep a piece of you when you are finished with it?  You will never forget the characters, their strengths, weaknesses, faults, triumphs, and fears?  A story that is so real it makes you want to do something greater in your life?  One with characters who steal a piece of your heart because their story was so touching?  A book that consumed you from the very beginning to the very end and you know that you will never forget the words you read from page 1 until the acknowledgments?Left Drowning is by far hands down the greatest book I have read this year, maybe even ever!  Blythe, Christopher (Chris), Sabin, Estelle, Eric, Zach, and James those characters will never be forgotten in my mind.  I can clearly close my eyes and picture them and who they are inside.  Jessica Park wrote such a beautiful and consuming storyline you can't help but fall in love with all of them.  They aren't perfect characters, they all have their demons, their insecurities, their fears but that's what makes them real.  They are all so very beautiful even in their imperfections in life.  Their story may not be roses and sunshine but it's their story and to me it's beautiful because it's real.--They, and mostly Chris, are saving me.  Or teaching me to save myself.  He is my port in the storm, and that's why I feel comfortable with what I'm going to do.  Chris is going to have to be strong, but I have hope that the story I'm about to tell him will help me, free me even.  He is the one person with whom I will remember what I have forgotten. - Left DrowningBlythe and Chris are the main characters in this story.  You will learn the all the ugly that happened in Blythe's life and all the beautiful that occurred too.  For everything she went through and had to endure I was surprised at how well she survived.  She is still missing something, someone and fate will step in and give her what she needs.  But what happens when Blythe learns to truth about everything, is it something she can forgive and bounce back from?  Or will the past and the truth leave her drowning in depression and loneliness?Chris has seen his fair share of the ugly in the world, growing up without a mother and having to basically take care of his 3 younger siblings, didn't leave him with much time to enjoy his childhood.  Growing up he learned to survive the bitterness and the abuse that was placed upon him, but he is only surviving, he isn't living.  He lives to take care of Sabin, Estelle, and Eric and will do anything for them to make sure that they have the best life they could have.  A chance meeting with Blythe will forever change Chris and the connection between the two is something so strong it can't be explained.  When Blythe lets her guard down towards Chris and shows him her demons will he stick by her side and start living or will it prove too much for him to handle and send him running in the opposite direction?\"Why does it still hurt so much?\" he asks.  \"Why can't we just move on and deal?\"--There is no set pattern to grief, despite what every stupid psych text has told me.  There is no time frame that dictates when and how you'll feel and what you feel.  You get to deal with hell however, and whenever, it hits you. - Left DrowningAside from Blythe's and Chris' story and accepting and moving on from their pass you will meet the other Shepherd siblings.  Estelle is the younger sister of Chris and is a beautiful and free spirited character.  She is a believer, when everyone around her has given up any type of faith in God or fate or destiny she holds true to her faith.  For me it was almost like her security blanket.  Sometimes I felt like she didn't believe in herself so she wanted to hold onto what she did believe in whether everyone else around her thought she was crazy or not.After meeting Blythe you will meet Sabin next.  He is a character, honest to a fault, crazy country boy who loves to have fun and loves women!  Deep down is a kindhearted and deep soul.  Sabin will do whatever he can to put a smile on your face and was such an easy character to fall in love with.  Deep down though he is damaged with what he saw growing up and he never learned how to channel those feelings leaving them bottled up inside him until he snaps.  Out of all the characters he was like a teddy bear for me, someone I would run to if I had a problem - almost like a big brother!You will also meet James, Blythe's little brother, who attends a different school than Blythe and they don't see much of each other.  They have a very complicated and broken relationship due to their past.  Guilt and blame is passed between the two and they have never been able to overcome their pasts and have a better relationship.  Hopefully over time when secrets are revealed these two can find their way back to each other as brother and sister and be a family again.Eric the other shepherd is Estelle's twin and is such a sweet, shy, and quiet character.  He doesn't say much but when he does everyone listens to what he has to say.  He is strong and determined.  You will be introduced to his boyfriend Zach and the love Zach has for Eric is contagious!  They truly are a beautiful couple.The whole Shepherd clan is such a tight knit family!  They all attend the same college so they can look after one another and make sure everyone is happy.  After learning what they went through as a family growing up they showed me how strong siblings need to be and how you need to stick beside your brothers and sisters no matter what and help them through anything.  This is what they do from the very beginning of the story until the very end.  They cheer for each other, they suffer heartaches with each other, they love each other with every ounce of their beings and no matter what at the end of the day they only have each other so they don't take anything for granted.\"You are the great love of my life that I'm never going to have.\"Okay I want to get back to Chris and Blythe because I will never forget this couple.  Everything that they went through before and after they met touched my heart.  I was rooting for them from the very beginning.  I laughed and I cried.  Things went just the way I wanted them to and some things, not so much.  There were times when I wanted to hold Blythe's hand and cry with her and then there were times when I wanted to celebrate with her.  All anybody ever wants is to be loved but sometimes that type of love can be scary and in some cases it's easier for someone to push that love away instead of embracing it and having it consume them.\"You said something last night that was completely wrong.  I could never touch anyone the way that I touch you.  And I will never regret falling in love with you. Don't forget that.\"And that is how we say good-bye.Jessica Park will have you learning new things about Blythe and Chris until the very end.  Their story continues to unravel throughout the entire book.  Little by little you will hear their story and learn how one person can endure so much, you will too fall in love with these characters and want them all to get their happily every after.  Left Drowning is hands down the best novel I have read this year if not to date.  It gave me everything I was wanting in a story.  It made me feel and fall in love with the characters and their story.  It was deep and meaningful and so different than what I usually read and that was a breath of fresh air.  Left Drowning is the first book that I have ever read of Jessica Park and if this is the type of story she is capable of giving us well than I am an instant fan.  I don't want to do this book injustice and rate it by stars because for me there aren't enough stars in the sky to give this book and what it meant to me.  I read a lot of books and sadly even the ones I enjoyed overtime I tend to forget sometimes the characters names and their story but with this one I don't think I ever will forget the story of Blythe, Chris, Sabin, Estelle, Eric, James, or Zach because their story touched my heart and warmed my soul.\"I will always be in love with you, even though you'll never love me back.  You have been my sanctuary this year.  You saved me.  Do you know that?  You saved me.  And I wish that you would let me save you.\" ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Human answer: The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I 'll tell you why\n",
      "Corresponding question: How is the remote?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The picture is pretty GOOD. I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I love urban fantasy a lot so I had to see this.  What a great idea, A guy related to the Grimm brothers has the sight and can see into the world of the supernatural and fights supernatural crime.  The only problem is that every episode is a bad clich&eacute;.  Lizard men eat rat people,  A pied piper dude controls rats that kill, etc.  Also everyone is white save the partner and one cop.  This would be fine if all the monsters were not white people.  This show takes place in Portland Oregon so you think there would be lots of run ins with Native American fey folk and monsters but no, not a one.  There are run ins with Wendigo but they are white people like every other supernatural clich&eacute; creature.I was kinda hoping for a Norwegian troll that runs a Kung Fu school helping them the gang to find a murder who is just a murderer of humans.  Maybe a tater that was taken from a circus but the tiger is actually a Chinese dude who stayed in tiger form so he would not get caught. America is so rich with people and cultures I'm surprised that this show resorts to making up stuff like beaver man and does not use any of the ethic groups actually living in Portland.I like the premise of the show, the actors and the characters but I feel they are trapped in a loop.  There were points when I felt the show could have gotten interesting but chose not to like (spoiler) when the blonde witch lady goes to seduce the partner.  If she actually liked the partner then you would get conflict and romance but it did not happen.  Our hero's romance is really boring and would be better if she was bitten by a werewolf or something but the best the show does is giving here amnesia which is so boring. The mom discovers our hero hanging out with two were people and says racist stuff and no one calls her a racist.  The list goes on.More complaints: (spoiler) Our hero's werewolf friend says he ate people but he never asks about that. He just hangs out with a people eater I guess.  His mom may have killed many harmless were creatures but he never asked her about that or about abandoning him.  It's ridiculous. I'm giving the show two stars but it is mostly for the idea and the actors. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the greatest love?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I almost didn't buy it because of the many bad reviews but after reading this I loved Abby and Travis's story! I have come to the conclusion that quite a number of people grew up with a \"charmed\" childhood and had it pretty good so I understand why they wouldn't \"get\" this story or like it. Life isn't all a bed of roses for everyone. And I like many others come from an abusive and violent childhood. My step-father didn't break things or hit other people, he hit me and my sister and my brother. The emotional, mental, and physical abuse he put us through was a nightmare. He appeared to be a great guy with a great life and no one thought differently. But I knew the monster he hid well. Travis's outbursts and breaking things is really nothing, he never hits Abby or any other woman. He is a bit possessive but he doesn't try to hide how he feels and is very aware when he messes up, I don't feel this books sends the wrong message. I have been known to violent outbursts and throwing things but I never hurt anyone. So I felt their story was actually refreshing to read something that didn't have the constant \"happy, happy, life is perfect to it.\" I can't wait to read Travis's POV! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I always dreamed about staying at the Fairmont, so I had high expectations. In reality the airport hotel we stayed at the night before we left SF impressed me more (and I expected less).I checked in and was told I have a room with a view of the buildings around me. I told the desk clerk that it was our wedding anniversary and she offered me an upgraded room - for an additional $60 or a less nice upgrade for $40. That really turned me off - I was already paying a ridiculous amount and if they have the room available why wouldn't they just upgrade me? Particularly since I'm a President's Club member at the Fairmont.Then she said she'd &quot;send something to my room&quot;. Nice touch, right? Nothing was ever sent - which is fine, but don't tease me.When I arrived in my room (actually a decent mini-suite) on the top floor of the old part of the hotel - there was was abosolutely no view - just decorations outside the window that prevented a view of the nearby buildings or the street.. The lobby is lovely, and the bartenders in the lobby bar were nice. The gym was crowded and nothing special. The Tonga Room restaurant was closed for a private party and we had a goof up with the Hertz counter in the hotel. Overall, nothing seemed to go quite right.We had a nice anniversary, but it would have been just as nice elsewhere. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

After almost an hour of waiting, we just decided to leave. Wanting to give this place another shot, we came right when it opened for dinner. We were seated immediately but it took a while for our server to get back to us! The couple beside us even came after we did and received their food first. The food itself was average. I love Thai and I've been to many Thai restaurants around the city and this really didn't do it for me. I did think the massaman curry was great. The different textures of the dish with the crunchy nuts, soft potatoes and tender chicken highlighted the flavours of the dish. However, the same could not be said about the Panang curry. The taste of the bell pepper was overpowering and left us disappointed. At a much higher price than many similar Thai places, it just did not feel worth it at all.

      "Corresponding review: OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: \"The Passion Of The Christ\" is brilliant and one of the best pictures of the year, so far! The movie focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' (Jim Caviezel) life leading up to his death and resurrection. This movie has some very graphic scenes, but don't let the violence concern you. It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in \"The Man Without A Face\" and William Wallace in \"Braveheart\", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar. He also well known as Dr. Gibbon in \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), Graham Hess in \"Signs\" (2002), Lt. Col. Hal Moore in \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), Nick Marshall in \"What Women Want\" (2000), Benjamin Martin in \"The Patriot\" (2000), Porter in \"Payback\" (1999), Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon movies (1987, 1989, 1992, 1998), Jerry Fletcher in \"Conspiracy Theory\" (1997), Tom Mullen in \"Ransom\" (1996), the voices of Rocky and John Smith in \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), Bret Maverick in \"Maverick\" (1994), Capt. Daniel McCormick in \"Forever Young\" (1992), Hamlet in \"Hamlet\" (1990), Mad Max Rockatansky in the Mad Max movies (1979, 1981, 1985, 2005 or 2006), and Fletcher Christian in \"The Bounty\" (1984). His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel's performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson's production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), \"Payback\" (1999), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), \"Fairy Tale: A True Story\" (1997), \"Forever Young\" (1992), \"Hamlet\" (1990), \"The Man Without A Face\" (1993), and \"Maverick\" (1994). The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald and Gibson is brilliant. The music by John Debney is brilliant. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is brilliant. The film editing by John Wright is brilliant. The production design by Francesco Frigeri and the costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is brilliant. The casting by Shaila Rubin is brilliant. The set direction by Carlo Gervasi is brilliant. The visual and make-up effects by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan is brilliant. This movie make a powerful point about how Jesus died and the point is brilliant and succeeds on every level. The language, which is in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, which is shown in English subtitles, proves that you don't need to speak English to have a brilliant film with heart and soul. Go see this movie now or if you can see it. This is an achievement on every level. It is a movie to remember forever. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The next day I chose this popping corn because of my new found cancer fear (Thanks Dr. Oz!).There were barely any dead kernels left each and every time we popped the corn.  We tried with oil, butter and finally coconut oil.  Coconut oil was by far the winner.  The kernels were fluffy, white and large each and every time.  If you are searching for an American produced product, Kosher-certified and whole grain then this will be the brand for you.  If you are into saving money and prefer a larger quantity because your family consumes popcorn almost daily then this is not the product for you!  It is just too expensive compared to the other brands available at your local supermarket coupled with promotional coupons.At the end, it pops prettier but it tastes the same.  Personally I do not have a popper and would have to prepare this on the stove top.  It was a H.A.S.S.L.E. each and every time... It just takes too much effort when you want to snack right at that moment.  If you have an air popper or brown paper bags, you can microwave just the way you would with the microwaveable bags.  Sorry Dr. Oz... I am caving and buying the bags again.Recommend if you have a rather small family or require the specific points that I have mentioned previously.  For our family, it is just too expensive.  Delicious but expensive. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Firstly, its a nice looking, compact, solid device.I have used it to stream video to and iPhone, iPad3, and an HTC One S. The video has been flawless, never a single stutter.  Getting pictures and other files on my devices has been flawless as well.I just used it in a desert racing environment and it held up superbly. I was able to download video we were recording in the field and photos also taken in the field, to it and then wirelessly stream the footage/files to the required mobile devices in the field.  Being able to stream to multiple devices without wires is a godsend.  Multiple people could watch the footage as needed, edits could be made and uploaded quickly.  Thanks to this little gem much of the work was done in the field. Unlike others I got over 10 hours usage on a single charge.The unit held up to the dusty environment without issue.I will agree with other reviewers that the included documentation was sparse, but a quick trip to Seagate's site remedied that.The device was very easy and very fast to setup.  The apps for the mobile devices downloaded quickly and installed without issue on the iOS and Android devices. I had a password protected wireless network in under 5 minutes...that is hard to beat!0PC operation via USB 3.0 was fast and easy, as expected.I don't have a single complaint about this device. In fact, I will add one or two more in the near future. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

It also has a vaguely medicinal taste about it, and as I mentioned in the headline, a lingering aftertaste. Whether that taste is good not depends on how much you like the flavor. As it is, I'm wishing I had some Diet Coke around.This isn't by any means a bad product, but I'm fairly sure that you could get the same effect with sugar-free Kool Aid or the like, and probably spend a lot less money.

      "Corresponding review: I am going to try to refrain from writing a lengthy review for this film, and keep it as succint as possible, although for a film like this, the task almost seems impossible. Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for \"darker times\", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents \"death\" or the \"ending\"), each of these four members seem to meet the \"finality\" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the \"speeding up\" and \"slowing down\" techniques are supposed to correlate with the \"speeding\" or \"raciness\" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the \"Winter\" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, \"I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality.\" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a \"psychotic disorder\" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The house is a dream. Would love to live there. It takes you back in time and you can see yourself in their shoes whether you are Lady Mary or Mrs. Patmore and you see their lives and dreams and what could be. Of course it is like a soap opera with the good and the bad. It is sad that we lost some great cast members like Lady Sybil, Matthew Crawley (cried) and O'Brien but she brought the evil side to the story.

      "Human answer: Composing anything more does n't serve much a purpose\n",
      "Corresponding question: What is the purpose to write this book?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Is there a point to reviewing this title? I mean really. It's almost like reviewing Lord of the Rings. Not to imply that Collins is the next Tolkien or anything. Far from it. My point it that as of penning this commentary there are more than seventy seven thousand reviews posted to Goodreads alone. Composing anything more doesn't serve much a purpose. Oh well, I review for my own amusement so let's get on with it, shall we?Collins can thank a good friend of mine for yet another five star review. Not literally of course. Having a blockbuster movie to her credit, I'm sure Collins is long past reading individual reviews. I should probably give Superman a shout out though. Without his recommendation I never would have bothered with the book in the first place. The Hunger Games first came to my attention via Goodreads and let's just say the tween hype surrounding the book was a major turn off. Much like Twilight, the book started showing up everywhere, relevant to the discussion at hand or not. I made a snap judgment and pretty much avoided the title like the plague. Then I received this recommendation. Ordinarily I would check out the blurb, debate if I was in the mood for the genre, probably browse a review or two, but I have a few friends with infallible taste in lit. They tell me I should read something and without a moment of hesitation, I track down a copy. As usual, his taste was spot on.Now I recently reviewed Susan Ee's Angelfall and I have to say, I enjoyed Katniss Everdeen for many of the same reasons I enjoyed Penryn Young. It is true, she has a certain aptitude for the bow but her talents are born out of a need to survive. She isn't perfection personified, the fantasy of every male comes in contact with or unusually gifted as say Bella Swan, Rory Deveaux, or Tessa Grey. Yes, I am that shallow. I pointed fingers and named names, but don't jump down my throat just yet. There isn't anything wrong with these heroines. I simply prefer the strength of character Collins features in Katniss as opposed to the inherent exceptional abilities of her counterparts.Moving on. For those who don't follow my reviews, I pretty much gave up on the Infernal Devices trilogy because I am sick to death of what has become a staple of young adult lit: the love triangle. Well, that and Clare's obvious obsession with Will's blue eyes but that is another story entirely. That in mind, Collins has me eating crow. I can hardly believe that in less than a month I am turning around and admitting I was wrong. Does this make me a hypocrite? Probably. Do I care? Not particularly. Why not? I'm so happy you asked.Gale and Peeta aren't engaged in a pissing match over a hopelessly smitten heroine who is all but begging to rip off her clothes. Collins, unlike some other authors, opts instead for a more conservative approach to teenage romance. Her heroine, Katniss, is conflicted but at this point in the game, she doesn't know how she feels about either boy. She has a relationship with Gale, but as yet, he has made no move to indicate a romantic interest and though she has no established relationship with Peeta prior to the Reaping, he declared his feelings quite plainly on live television. That's pretty much it. Now, I think it is obvious Collins intends to develop the idea in the following installments but she doesn't allow it to overshadow the rest of the piece and for that reason, and that reason I am willing to let the issue slide.So if The Hunger Games isn't mired is a sea of melodramatic drivel, what does Collins spend twenty nine chapters writing about? To be perfectly frank, she takes the road less traveled and offers up an honest to God, solidly constructed, fast-paced, hang on to your butts cause you wont believe what happens next, page turning piece of fiction. I wont go into the details. I'd end up spoiling something for the those few individuals who haven't yet jumped on The Hunger Games bandwagon. Suffice it to say that this is one of the few occasions I believe the author deserving of the royalties garnered through the film adaptation of their work.Generally speaking I like to add a note of criticism to my reviews, but in regards to The Hunger Games, I got nothing. Either I never identified an issue or I was so blown away by the story that I completely forgot I had one. Collins, I tip my hat to you. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How is the film?\n",
      "Corresponding review: \"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World\" is the magnificent movie dramatization of the characters of Patrick O'Brian's Naval novels.Set in the Napoleonic Wars, the storyline is built around the pursuit by British Royal Navy Captain \"Lucky\" Jack Aubrey and his ship, HMS Surprise, of the French warship \"Acheron\".  The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.  The sequences at sea, whether rounding the Horn in horrendous weather or boarding an enemy vessel, are thrilling and well-executed.This movie is highly recommended as a thrilling drama and as a glimpse into the British Royal Navy at what was arguably its peak as the best navy in the world.

The street to lobby elevator required a hotel staff member with a specific lift key to operate each time we entered and exited the hotel. In the evening when we returned from dinner, the front desk staff had to call maintenance to have the key brought to the lobby. It was awkward and we waited about 15 minutes to get into the hotel.

      "Corresponding question: How is the script?\n",
      "Corresponding review: ***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing \"Requiem For a Dream,\" a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, \"Requiem For a Dream,\" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.

      "Corresponding review: First impressions: Package was easy to open - and by that I mean the individually wrapped cracker things.  You know how sometimes those plastic-encased things can be hard to open?  No?  Well, sometimes I have trouble with them.  But this took little effort to tear into.  I opened it up and:BAM!  That smell of cheese hit me in the face.  But not cheese - specifically, it smelled of cheese-whiz.  That stuff was awesome - when I was in college.  You know cheese-whiz?  I used to love spraying that junk on RITZ crackers on college while watching TV.But I'm not in college anymore.After the strong smell of fake-cheese hits you, a hint of wheat makes itself known.  That's the cracker part of these things.I pulled out the \"crakerfull\" only to have it come apart in my hand.  I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on \"wheat\" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.  They don't look like they're marketed towards kids - but they sure do not taste like anything a grown-up would want. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: After waiting months and months for Entwined With You to come out, especially with the release date being pushed back, I was very worried that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations of what I remembered of Gideon and Eva. I was wrong. I was not disappointed. The passion and chemistry between them was just as intense if not more!I felt like I got to know Gideon a whole lot more in this book than I did in the previous two in the series. Gideon's fears and vulnerability were more prevalent. He was still the all-consuming alpha male that I adore, but I loved being able to see his tenderhearted part a little more.Eva and Cary's relationship took a little more of an interesting edge to it as Eva had to keep secrets from her best friend, whom she used to tell every aspect of her life to. Also, having Eva's father, Victor make another appearance, added a little more drama and background into Eva's life.I didn't like Corrine from the beginning in the first book, and I disliked her even more with her involvement in this one. I actually liked having Brett around again. I think he adds a certain flair for drama and angst that makes it a little more interesting.As always, the sex in the Crossfire books was amazing! The steaminess and intimacy factors were a lot more intense. The connection between Gideon and Eva seemed to have risen to an entirely different level than that of Bared to You and Reflected In You. Some scenes in particular were just mind-blowing and scorching!I am very happy that Entwined With You isn't the end of the road for Gideon and Eva, I think that their story definitely has some more obstacles and twists that can make for very interesting follow ups. I just hope that we don't have to wait quite as long for the next one as we did between Reflected and Entwined. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

The rooms have high-celings and nice (if a bit worn) empire furniture, but they don't seem as grand as the rest of the building and they don't live up to the Luxury Collection expectations I had when I checked in. The service here is merely adequate, not bad, but not really good either. I was, frankly, surprised, as my experiences at other Luxury Collection properties have all been marked by very good to excellent service. My stay at the Palace (earlier this month) was fine, but I doubt I'd stay here again.

The set up with the iPad opposite to the keyboard and with the 360 degree rotation is nothing short of brilliant. Landscape or portrait, choose your angle or flip the top over for tablet use, no other case is so versatile.This case is light and sturdy. All the edges are smooth and clean. The iPad fits perfectly and securely inside the cover. All the access points fit perfectly along the edge of the iPad.The keyboard is of great quality. Easy bluetooth connection. Long lasting battery charge. The chiclet type keys are firm but sensitive and sized for the slim or fat fingers alike. The screen closes firmly with a clic.The screen support is light but strong and allows the screen to sit at different angles while it rests close against the keyboard.The right case for light and medium duty.

      "Corresponding review: Yes, a nice hotel that not only accepts pets at no extra charge but actually has services to cater to them. I was able to take my diabetic cat with me rather than board him and spare the worry and guilt. They do require you to sign a policy that says that pets are not allowed to be unattended in the room. I imagine this is to prevent barking from lonely dogs, and protection against liability. The nature of my visit forced me to ignore their policy, and I slipped the maid a few bucks to smooth things over and arranged times to service the room since they won't enter with a pet present if you are not there. The housekeeping staff is very nice and accommodating, something I find is rare in US hotels. This is one of the few hotels that I can honestly say there wasn't a thing I could find to complain about, and I'm no pushover. I asked for a quiet room, and they gave me a room (Rm 1217) with no common walls with other guests. Though it was right next to the elevator, I never heard anyone else. They reserve the 12th floor for guests with pets and I think I had the floor largely to myself. The rooms were spotless, tastefully furnished, and bathrobes provided. The onsite restaurant is a wireless hotspot. The hotel hosts a nightly complementary happy hour and the staff urges you throughout the day to attend. Every time I returned to the hotel the door was opened for me with a very hearty &quot;welcome back!&quot; I highly recommend that you book directly on the serranohotel.com site. They have a price match guarantee with benefits. So I booked direct then priced it on Expedia, which was lower of course. I called the hotel, and they matched the price with no problem. I saved $112 this way. Plus the price match guarantee includes a free upgrade and late checkout, and they did upgrade my room upon request for free. The only problem I had the entire stay was upon check out they had slipped in an additional $10 charge for the valet parking ($35 a day) because they said my vehicle was oversized. I drive a midsize, and I argued the point. After a minute or so the bell captain and doorman jumped to my defense and vouched to the clerk that my car was by no stretch of the imagination oversize. The desk clerk rescinded the charge with a very nice apology. I will most definitely stay at the Serrano whenever I am in San Francisco again. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Duo of Tartare of beef & salmon was a perfect portion of meats and baby bannocks. If there's foie gras on a menu I have to order it. The S'mores foie gras was a balanced combination of savoury and sweet. This starter is a must have when coming here. To finish something light the apricot  mousse from their Summerlicious menu.

And glad I did tho I received just the single disc and I see that the Blu Ray and  Digital version are offered at the same price.I watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.  Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.  There was only one scene towards the end, which contained an army officer in a truck of solders( don't want to spoil it so I am not saying what happens in this scene) that I thought could have been left out; seemed really cheesy to me.I'm not into book reports so here's my take on the transfer quality only.  Get it.  The video is quite outstanding...beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.  No grain, no artifacts, nothing to take away from  the demo transfer quality that this is.The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and, in many parts, is also demo worthy.  There really is an expansive sound stage and perfect directionality from the discreet speakers when appropriate.Unless you don't like the movie itself, there is no reason not to have this King Kong on blu ray.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I need to do a lot of teleconferencing on the road.  Most of these phone meetings are with people in other countries (i.e. some accent), and they usually use a speaker phone instead of individual headsets.  I have been using a one ear Bluetooth headset, and could hardly hear what they were saying.  I need a headset that covers both ears.  So, I bought this headset because of its good reviews.The sound quality of this headset is wonderful.  I can now hear people's conversation much better than before.  It comes with ear pieces of 3 different sizes.  I really like the ear pieces as they fit into my ears very well and block most of the outside noise.  For headphone sound quality, I'll give it 5 stars.However, the microphone quality is not that good.  It is very sensitive and pick up a lot of background noise.  People can hear me clearly if I'm indoor in a quiet room, but if I'm outdoor usually they have problem hearing me.  One of my coworkers is using the 700 model, and he complains the same thing.  For microphone quality, I'll give it only 2 stars.I have also been using this headset a lot when I do exercise (elliptical machine/jogging).  It's light weight, and its Bluetooth connection is very good.  I can put my phone 15 feet away and enjoy my music.  When I used my old one ear headset for music, the connection was not that good even if I put the phone in my pants pocket.  I used it on iPhone 4S and iPad 3 for music, phone calls, and audible app.  All Bluetooth controls work fine. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing & worth writing about.Batman Begins (Batman 5) is bigger, better & bolder than all its predecessors. The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman & not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.This movie is Batman all the way. The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role. He might seem a bit too young for the role of Bruce Wayne however we need to keep in mind that this is Batman \"Begins\" hence him being young.The entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things. The Batmobile was a bit rugged as opposed to refined, the three main fight scenes (The one in jail, the one at the School & the last one) were really quick & you can't quite make heads or tales of it. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie the weather was probably cold but Christopher Nolan did not have to use Katie Holmes' assets to get the message across - on IMAX it is very evident - for those who have no clue what I am talking about, watch the movie & you decide.As for the cast; excellent choice, everyone of them. Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his \"mentor\" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her. She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies & is dating Tom Cruise. Life is good. I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike. Bale is great as Batman & is very convincing. Great movie, well made, well filmed & I am sure it'll be well liked as well.Rating: 4 &  stars.

      "Corresponding review: Starbucks coffee, in particular the dark French Roast blend, is one of my favorites. When Starbucks came up with the Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I thought I'd give it a try.First impressions:  The vanilla flavored coffee is full-bodied and smooth. It is best described as a dark French Roast with a *hint* of vanilla flavor, which complements the coffee quite nicely. Now, for folks who are into vanilla-flavored creamers, you will appreciate being able to use as much creamer as you like without worrying about overpowering your coffee with vanilla.I'm not a particularly big fan of flavored coffee, but I am surprised I actually enjoyed this coffee a fair bit. I'm glad that it's flavored with real vanilla beans, not with artificial flavoring. Give the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee a try. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The expectation for this film was incredible. And I loved it the first time I saw it... but that was high on excitement and I was with a dozen friends. Then I saw it again. And oh, MY, it's a bad film!!The Yoda fight scene DID rock, tho, yes, it did. (The only awesome part of the movie!)The script is bad, and we are left, again, wondering what this whole thing is about. I was so confused at the end of the first movie as to WHY there was all these battles, and what did it really matter in the end? Well, it doesn't really matter. That's what this movie showed us. These two films are totally disconnected in plot, except the personal strain going through them. (Maybe 3 will answer questions and loose ends, but I doubt it.) The acting was weak, and Anakin was more concerned with getting his way with Padme, rather than seeming genuinely in love with her. I realise that these two felt a passionate, carefree love in comparison with the more mature Han/Leia love, but the downright lust and danger of Anakin was annoying and disturbing. She wouldn't have gone for him. Her acting wasn't any better. And who wrote those lines for her? Talk about cheese!With a weak script and bad young actors (except, of course, Chris Lee and Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid) Lucas has succeeded in showing the world that movies cannot ride on CGI and fame of a name alone. Well, he'd like to think so, wouldn't he?None of the spark and substance of the original, though we're closer to it than the first movie. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: cast is likewise solid\n",
      "Human answer: mixture of action , humor and romance\n",
      "Corresponding question: What types of film they show in the travel?\n",
      "Corresponding review: \"Spider-Man\" as directed Sam Raimi, serves to prove that a movie can be greater than the sum of its parts.  There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  \"Spider-Man\" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.Ultimately, \"Spider-Man\" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!Enjoy! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

There is a Japanese restaurant inside the hotel that had amazing sushi. The price is pretty high, but well worth it in today's market, especially for business travelers.

The new screen on the \"FHD\" is gorgeous, battery life is great and I've had zero issues with it.I waited quite a while for a six inch tablet. This is the closest I could get to that without going the smartphone route. I don't use my phone much, pay $11 a month and don't want to pay for a cell phone account.

I can't understand anyone's justification for going the iPad Mini route when you can have twice the quality and performance at 1/3rd the price.If you know you can get apps you need for Android, then just go with a tablet that isn't stamped with the \"Apple\" label. The only time I could't justify someone getting an iOS tablet is musicians, which have many apps for direct guitar plug-in, piano/keyboard and many other music-based effects that are hard to find (for now) on Android.Otherwise, there's no reason to waste your money on something that just has a company's logo on it as proof of \"quality\".

      "Human answer: this is n't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste\n",
      "Corresponding question: How was the snack?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The snack basically consists of 2 high fiber crackers with processed cheese spread between them. The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads \"Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors\", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say \"Natural Flavors\" already!  It's like saying \"Rainy with a chance of showers\" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.  I'll even upgrade the product from 3 stars to 2 because of this! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

One of our server's got upset at us because we ordered our dim sum wrong even though we weren't given clear instructions on how to order. It was almost as if our food wasn't cared about. It took them quite a long time to bring our food out and the server's never really checked on our table or answered our requests until like the fifth time we asked them.

      "Corresponding review: I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth, or that sticky slime in the back of the throat (or is that just me?), or BURN going down.  It tastes \"fresh,\" for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a \"cleaner\" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as \"juice,\" except by fanatics.)Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.  I liked it enough to want to try out the other flavors... ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Not the most glamorous view, but I didn''t book the room for it''s view (choose the Grand Hyatt for that.)\\nAt night the music from the 2nd-floor jazz bar was loud for a few hours. This, and the lack of a desk in the room, made it less than ideal as a room for a business trip if you want to get work done in the evenings.\\nAlso, on the last morning, the elevator was having trouble (it was forgetting floor calls and making mostly empty trips while frustrated guest waited and waited and eventually took the stairs with their suitcases.) I noticed that the elevator had _just_ been inspected that day or the day before. The hotel staff apologized and had the repair company on the way, but we still had to hike a lot of floors with suitcases.\\nOther issues notwithstanding, the decor and unique vibe were a welcome break from a long string of cookie-cutter, soulless, business-traveller oriented hotels I have stayed in before.

      "Corresponding review: The movie Chicago has it all. Music, Dancing, Sexiness and Style. I watched the movie in theatres hoping that it will exceed my expectations and it did...a lot. The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back. So check this movie out and you'll see what Chicago has up it's sleeve. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

Both characters have their own definite personalities and ways of expressing themselves.Some find fault with the ending of this tricky tale, but for me it was satisfying and fitting.

      "Corresponding review: My boyfriend and I travelled from London to San Francisco and checked in for 6 nights at the Carlton.It's a relatively cheap hotel and good value for money, in a fairly central location (if you don't mind walking - which is what you do in San Francsico anyway!).Our room on the first night was nice and clean and decor good, but we had the worst night's sleep due to noisy neighbours and VERY thin walls. Lack of sleep coupled with jet lag was not a great start to our stay! First thing the next morning we told reception our complaints and they were SO helpful and friendly and booked us into a different room and had all our luggage moved whilst we were out for the day. The second room was bigger and again nice and great decor - admittedly we decided to pay a little bit extra per night for this room (only about $10 i think) in the hope that we would get more sleep. Although our new neighbours were no where near as noisy as the first set, because of the thin walls we were repeatedly woken up from people returning to their room, or the plumbing of of an adjacent room's bathroom - and well, we just didn't sleep that well (which we should have done with all the sight seeing throughout the day!). It was fairly disappointing and we decided not to return to that hotel, as we had previously booked, after a week in Yosemite and Lake Tahoe.On the plus side, we thought the breakfast was great (although you can get it cheaper elsewhere) and the staff were so nice and helpful.

      "Corresponding review: Heard great things about this place, but slightly disappointed overall.For a start, the service was great and our waiter was very attentive. Appetisers wise, we ordered the squash fritters, the chicken wings, and a starter bowl of tom yum soup. The chicken wings were amazing, and I especially liked that the tom yum soup was slightly sweet instead of being too sour like it is at most places. The squash fritters were tasty, but the portion was huge - way too much for 2 persons, and more suitable for a party of 4 or 5. For mains, we ordered the green curry in a coconut and the basil pork. The green curry was great, but we waited about 30 minutes for it. We also specifically requested it to be served piping hot, but to our disappointment, the curry arrived to our table at room temperature. This was the same for our tom yum soup, which was unfortunate. The basil pork was good, but I have definitely had better. Sangria was great - refreshing and tasty. The Thai iced tea was way too sweet, but not too bad. Restaurant had a trendy, eccentric hipster vibe, and was overall not a bad dining experience. More towards a 3.5 stars. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the main concept of books?\n",
      "Corresponding review: The Time Traveler's Wife never appealed to me because of the title.  I don't usually care for science fiction and time traveling, but my friend recommended the novel and gave me a copy as a gift, so I tried it out.  Just as I expected, I didn't care for the time traveling.  I found the first thirty pages terribly confusing as dates and ages jumped around.  For me, The Time Traveler's Wife had a rough start, but it picked up after the first hundred pages or so once I figured out the time structure of the story, and it culminated with the final scene as the best scene in the book.The book tells the love story between Henry, a librarian plagued with a genetic disorder that causes him to involuntarily time travel, and his wife Clare.  The story and concept are unique, interesting, and captivating.  They touch upon a wide variety of philosophical topics, such as love, free will, age differences within relationships, sex, waiting for love, and genetic therapy.  It provides a lot of material for both self-reflection and discussion with others.Although I enjoyed reading the novel and became engrossed in the storyline, I also found many faults with the book.  My main complaint is that the characters were flat.  The story is told with the alternating perspectives of Henry and Clare, however, I oftentimes could not remember whose perspective I was reading.  The two characters are too similar and are poorly developed as separate individuals.  Henry is clearly the main character, and Clare simply waits for him throughout her entire life.  Some people might find her relentless waiting as a testament to her love for Henry, but I found it pathetic and irritating.  She has no personality beyond Henry.  Furthermore, I found Henry interesting because of his time traveling predicament, but he is not at all what I would envision of as a romantic hero in a love story.  The author sets up numerous situations in which she could have explored their deeper emotions, but instead she only skims the surface.  Similarly, the author sets up some great supporting characters, but fails to give them any depth.In the end, The Time Traveler's Wife is not a bad book, but it's not a great book either.  The story and concept were captivating, but unfortuantely, the characters were disappointing. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: How fantastic is the aroma?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

      "Corresponding question: How is it the story line?\n",
      "Corresponding review: Before anyone gets upset that I am reviewing this film before it is released in theaters, I want to let it be known I was fortunate enough to get advanced screening passes for the film. Guillermo del Toro directs two types of films, high concept art house type films usually in Spanish(Pans Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone), and action blockbusters with high budgets and heavy use of CGI (Blade II, Hellboy, and its sequel), this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise. The dialogue feels canned and cheesy one-liners fly from the mouths of nearly every actor in this film. The plot is as thin and predictable as it is farfetched, but this could all have been guessed from watching the trailer as well.A few actors who weren't featured in the trailers make appearances, I won't spoil who they are or what roles they play, but they are a pleasant surprise as they provide some relief from a story that is a little too serious at times. While no one makes Oscar worthy performance, the acting is perfectly acceptable and on par with most action movies, although some of the actors are not the greatest at American English accents in spite of their efforts. I suppose this can be explained away as the film is set in the future, and who knows what American English will sound like then (I'll bet it will sound quite a lot like mine, my parents', and my grandparents' accents).While the plot, dialogue, and acting are on par with every other action blockbuster of the past decade, I must admit that the CGI and visuals are some of the most realistic I have seen. The visual effects are stunning. Thanks to the amazing work of Industrial Light and Magic there is not a single scene in the film where I felt as though the CGI was blatantly apparent beyond the fact that such things do not exist, something I wish I could say about the recently released Man of Steel. The 3d is also quite good, sometimes 3d is a little overdone and it feels unnatural and hurts your eyes, this is fortunately not the case with this film. This 3d experience is easily on par with Avatar, probably the result of a film which was intended for 3d from the get go. All in all this film is an entertaining escape, albeit one that may not be too surprising or particularly memorable. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

I was easily able to sit and read this book in a matter of just a few hours while on vacation.  At times, it was even hard to put down.I had originally picked up the book because I thought that it would prove to be an interesting mystery.  However, I soon discovered that the book was less about a mystery and more about relationships.  Not only the relationship between lovers, but also the relationship between people and dogs.  It truly brought out the animal lover in me, and for that, I'm grateful.To tell you anything further in a review may ruin the story for readers who have not yet had the opportunity to experience \"The Dogs of Babel,\" so I will leave my review short.

Simple, but clean, this hotel afforded a great location for the money--a block in from the Bay right between Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. Even my elderly mother with arthritic feet had no trouble walking to the attractions along waterfront. Other reviews claimed much noise--to us it was no more noise than any other city. The biggest drawback was no air conditioning. My sister, mother and I were concerned when we opened the door to what felt like an oven. But after airing the room out by keeping the door open and putting on the ceiling fan, it cooled down enough and afforded a pleasant night's sleep on comfortable beds.

      "Corresponding review: I was job shadowing in Parkdale when I came across Grand Electric. Having heard many favourable reviews, I decided to pop in for lunch. The bar had a very relaxed vibe. There was loud hip hop music playing and the staff were in casual clothes. The space wasn't very big but luckily I came at a less busy time because apparently the wait time to be seated takes forever during certain hours.There were no hand-out menus and their entire menu was on a chalkboard. Therefore, the choices were pretty limited. When I saw that the tacos were $3.60 each, I cringed a little. I hummed and hawed for a bit before deciding on one Baja Fish taco and one Belly Pork taco.When I received the tacos, I understood immediately why people warned me about how pricey Grand Electric was. The size of the tacos were so small! Someone who enjoyed having more substance in her meal, I wasn't too please with the portions. There was no way I was going to order another round to get a satisfying lunch because I knew it was going to cost me a hefty penny.I definitely love the Baja Fish taco. It was extremely tasty and unique. The pork belly was also good, but being Asian and having to eat a lot of pork belly already, it was nothing new. If you come to Grand Electric, you would definitely appreciate the gourmet tacos. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Long and overdue re-review. 4.5 stars - Momofuku graciously invited me back, and I was a lot more happy with the service and food I received. I came here with my sister, who had never been to Momofuku, to try some of their foods. We were seated on the second floor, which offered a gorgeous view of the outside. I'm not sure if this is available for normal visitors, but I loved dining from an elevated position that allowed us to people watch.We ordered the roasted rice cakes, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and they also presented us with a special dish - their twist in Korean bbq.The roasted rice cakes had an amazing texture. The crispness of the outside paired with the pillowy inside of the rice cakes made for an amazing appetizer. It was a little under seasoned though, and I almost found myself wishing that there was a dip for it on the side perhaps.The pork buns, as always, were simply amazing. This is hands-down the best item on their menu. I know people rave about it constantly, but if you need to choose something to order, try their buns!! My sister was wide-eyed when she had one and loved it.The ginger scallion noodles were tasty, but greasy. The noodle texture had a great elasticity and provide a good bite. The seasoning itself, on first bite, was amazing. However, I felt that it could use more ginger to provide more to the dish. After 2 or 3 bites, the oil starts coating your mouth, so the flavour of ginger would really help to reset your palate. There just wasn't enough ginger to help cut through the grease.The cold Korean bbq was beautifully presented, and in a fun DIY manner that it's known for. It was served with gochujang on the platter, a medium rare steak, and vibrant greens. The steak was beautifully cooked, but again, it could've used another punch of flavour. The steak wasn't seasoned well enough for that extra impact. I feel like this could've pushed it over the edge if it had slightly better seasoning.We also had drinks with our meal, the paper crane and a melon drink. Paper crane was a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the melon drink was a fantastic one. I'd also like to add that our service was AMAZING! Shout out to our waitress!Our meal ended with their famous cereal milk soft serve, which I always get when I visit. Overall, service was amazing, ambience was amazing, and the food just needed some minor tweaking for my tastes. Apart from that, I am super excited to come back and visit again now that I know what to order with confidence. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: A mix between \"Eyes Wide Shut\", \"National Treasure\" and Oliver Stone's \"JFK\", Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is an exciting novel wrapped in intrigue, suspense, and controversy.To criticize the book for offering one dimensional characters, silly plot twists, and predictable discoveries about conniving figures who we thought were good-guys would be disingenuous on my part, since I particularly enjoy entertaining stories without much depth. Curator Jacques Sauniere is murdered in the Louvre, and professor Robert Langdon, innocent yet the primary suspect, and cryptologist/granddaughter of the victim Sophie Neveu go on a wild adventure running separately from the cops, the tall limping albino Opus Dei monk who really committed the murder, and the secret \"Teacher\" orchestrating the crime, while at the same time trying to figure out the mystery behind the hidden secret Sauniere was killed for. We find out that Sauniere was part of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has and protects the true identity and nature of the Holy Grail. The Albino monk is Silas, a member of spooky Catholic organization Opus Dei, working for his mentor Archbishop Aringarosa and the unknown Teacher, to seek out the Grail for ad majorem dei gloriam. French police chief Bezu Fache seems too religious, and arouses suspicion about his motives in pursuing Langdon. Luckily, Langdon knows Sir Leigh Teabing, a prominent Grail scholar eager to help in their search, in the hopes of revealing the \"truth\" of the Grail to a world that has been denied it by the \"evil\" Church. But, would Sauniere really have wanted the truth revealed?It would be simple if this work of fiction were really just a lighthearted work of fiction. However, Brown offers a disclosure stating that certain parts of the book are true. Yes, he is sure to point out that, while the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei exist, the main characters who are members are fictional, and while pointing out that descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals are true, he never makes any claims about the historical theories put forth by the characters. Yet, it is these claims by the characters that have excited the popular imagination and must be confronted.Both Langdon and Teabing refer anachronistically to \"the Vatican\" when criticizing past historical actions of the Church. Whether or not the claims made about the Church are true, it is incorrect to refer to the actions of \"the Vatican\" in the 15th century, much less the 3rd and 4th century. Vatican Hill, the location in Rome where St. Peter's Basilica and Vatican City are located, has only in the last few centuries been the seat of Church governance. Before then, the Pope's home base (and still the official Cathedral Church of the diocese of Rome) was the Cathedral of St. John Lateran in Rome. The 4th century, the era most derided in the book, the Pope was not in practical terms \"in charge\" of the Church, and East and West were still more than half a millennium from splitting. The Catholic Church as we know today, and Teabing loves to bash, was not around then. There was a Catholic Church, but it included both West and East, Latin and Greek, unlike today, where it is just Latin and few Eastern Rite Churches.Teabing and Langdon's major theses involve the idea that the Holy Grail is not the chalice of the Last Supper, but the blood line of the children of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, a 2000 year old secret that would shock the world. We learn in the book that the Priory of Sion heroically protects the secret by meeting and having \"Eyes Wide Shut\" style orgies. But, why keep this fact a secret? Why not tell the whole world that Mary Magdalene and our homeboy JC got...it...on? Then we can all have orgies.Book claim: \"Constantine made Jesus divine.\" But you see, Teabing tells Sophie when Langdon and she seek refuge in his mansion, the Church has suppressed this truth. All the early Christian followers \"knew\" that Jesus was just a swell guy, descended from the royal blood of David who married Mary Magdalene of the royal line of Benjamin to make a super royal bloodline. But, Emperor Constantine ruined all the fun. He had the JC-MM marriage written out of the Bible, and decided to \"make\" Jesus divine at the Council of Nicea in 325, in what turned out to be a real close vote. Now, since Jesus is divine, no one can challenge the Christian religion of the Empire. A divine Jesus could not have a wife, so Mary Magdalene gets hush-hushed. From then on out, Christianity phased out the pagan practices of goddess worship, cut out the divine feminine, and the world started stinking.My rebuttal: Whether or not Jesus is divine is matter of faith. However, from a historical perspective, it is incorrect to claim that Constantine is the first to call Jesus divine. Since the time of Jesus, there have been many followers who have considered Jesus to be God, to be one with the Father. Yes, there also were followers, such as Arius, who placed Jesus as less than God, and the merits of the decision at Nicea is a much wider topic than a book review, but it is historically false to claim that there were not early Christians who believed in Christ's divinity. Also, the vote at Nicea was not close. It was an extreme majority that voted in favor of the Creed.Book claim: \"Jesus married Mary Magdalene.\" It is claimed by Teabing and Langdon that Jesus must have married Mary Magdalene because he loved her, references to kisses he gave her in apocrophal (non-canonical) gospels, and the \"fact\" that all Jewish men married then.My rebuttal: However, in reality there is solid evidence against the view that Jesus married. NOT all Jewish men married. There was always a place for asceticism in Judaism. The Dead Sea Scrolls, just discovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945, were not early Christian texts, as mentioned in the DaVinci Code, but rather Jewish religious texts written by the Essenes, one group among a number of Jewish celibate ascetics, the equivalent of later Christian monks. While most Jewish men married, it was not unheard of for some to remain celibate. And, since marriage was looked highly upon, and all the great Jewish leaders from the Old Testament were married and had their wives mentioned, the only reason not to mention a wife of Jesus was that he probably did not have one. After all, at this time, it would have made Jesus look better to have been married. The only reason not to mention it is it is not true.Book claim: \"Sex is sacred.\" We can see the true colors of the Priory of Sion, the defenders of the \"truth\" of the Grail, in Sophie's traumatizing experience that drove her from her grandfather. An orgy to show that sex is sacred? Actually, this is not a \"new\" idea. All of the ancient pagan religions believed that sex was divine, and many practiced ritualized sex. This is supposedly in contrast to the Church, which through the \"fictional\" story of Original Sin, has made sex dirty and shameful.My rebuttal: It is true that the Church does not consider sex to be divine. Unlike the straw-man that is set up to be torn down in the DaVinci Code, the Church also does not consider sex to be evil or dirty. Sex is a normal human activity. Not demonic or divine. It is good and a gift of God, but thoroughly human. And, frankly, whether one is someone who believes that sex is only for marriage or that sex is for any two (or more) consenting adults, I think we can all agree that it is kind of creepy and weird to call sex divine or sacred or religious. It does not cure cancer or make you fly or anything. It's sex. Even animals do it.Book claim: \"No need to reveal the \"truth\" of the Holy Grail.\" Let's pretend for a second that there really was a big cover up, and the Church has kept the Priory of Sion, under threat, from revealing the truth, and that is why they have to keep the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene a secret, only meeting once in awhile to perform some, um, rituals. Teabing is secretly the Teacher orchestrating the murder of Sauniere and seeking out the Grail because he thinks the \"truth\" that JC and MM married should be shouted from the rooftops. Langdon hedges, because Sauniere, the Grand Master leader of the Sion's, did not want it told, and, as Langdon says, \"if you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted holy stories of...belief, should we do that?\" After all, \"those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical,\" i.e. religious faith is based on fantasy, and it does not matter what one believes if it makes him feel good and he is nice to others. Plus, as we find out from Sophie's long lost grandmother who is not really dead like we earlier thought, the \"truth\" about Mary Magdalene and Jesus' marriage is found in art, historical objects, writings, phallic objects, and nature. Riiiiight. No reason to tell people the truth. We are the enlightened ones who have it.My rebuttal: Obviously, this is very patronizing. It conjures up images of the Grand Inquisitor who \"knew\" there was no God, but burned heretics to spare people the unbearable truth of a life without hope. If something is true, why not reveal it? And, the idea that the \"important\" truths are meant to be hidden and only known by the enlightened few is not Christianity, but Gnosticism. True Christianity is for everybody. Jesus did not come for just for the enlightened few. His message is for us all.If Jesus is just a man, and not divine, what is the point of worshipping him, or Mary Magdalene, or their \"sacred\" bloodline? The reason why Christians worship Jesus, and do not just revere him as a prophet like Moses or Muhammad, is because we believe him to be the God whose love is stronger than death, who offers us hope for new life after this one. And, far from disgracing Mary Magdalene's name, the Church honors her. Who but she is revered as the one who is definitively present at the empty tomb to witness the Risen Lord? ANSWERNOTFOUND\n"

      "Corresponding question: How is the texture?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I like the texture of this product; it reminds me of stone-ground or coarse-ground bread.  I am generally a fan of crackers with a cheese filling, but the flavor of the cheese filling only moderately enthused me.  I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an \"excellent source of fiber.\"  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an \"excellent\" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of \"excellent\" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of \"excellent\"?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an \"excellent\" source of fiber, or at least a \"good\" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the \"excellent\" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: loved the layout and decor\n",
      "Human answer: just are\n",
      "Corresponding question: Is it a good decor?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I recently spent three nights at the Mandarin Oriental for a quick leisure trip to San Francisco. I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental.After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives.1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay.2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good.1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean.2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space.3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying.5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly.But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again. The price was reasonable for a luxury hotel in one of the world's greatest cities, and I really, really loved the room. The pictures posted on trip advisor and on the hotel website are accurate.

      "Corresponding review: Overall, I liked the cookies for their flavor, pleasant aroma and texture.  However, while somewhat moist and pleasantly chewy, they did taste a little dry. I had a few with my usual coffee, and they paired quite well.  I also had a few with milk, and that didn't turn out well.The cookies actually reminded me of a few of the high-fiber energy bars on the market.  The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.  I tried pairing it with milk, and it did not dip well (it fell apart when wetted), though it did taste good with milk.  Still, the fiber content and heft alone have their merits, and in a pinch, I would definitely take a few bites. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Wrong annotation: restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was with serendipitous timing that enroute magazine unleashed its best\n",
      "Human answer: regarded place\n",
      "Corresponding question: What was the quality of the lamb?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I hate to give such a highly-regarded place three stars, but here goes nothing.In the thralls of finding a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was with serendipitous timing that enRoute magazine unleashed its Best New Restaurants in Canada upon the web. Top of the list? Edulis, a local restaurant, thus relieving me of any need to continue my search. (They also made MacLean's Top 50 Best Restaurants in Canada.) A couple emails later, and our table was booked. (They say an online reservation system is coming soon.) Cozy and charming, this intimate restaurant is tucked away on a rather nondescript stretch of Niagara St. just south of King. The juxtaposition of the best restaurant in Canada facing onto a large co-op housing complex is worthy of note, and could serve as an archetype for boosters of mixed-income urban planning near and afar. Anyway, I digress.Debating between the smaller ($50) or larger ($70) tasting menus, our waitress indicated that the former would be sufficient to fill our bellies. We opted for the latter, and were prepared to have to undo a few buttons. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Look, I get that higher-end restaurants skew towards smaller portions; I have no problem with that, and come to expect it. But if I'm ordering a seven-course tasting menu, I expect to be reasonably satiated by the end of the journey. Am I completely off base here? Alas, if it weren't for the constant re-filling of our bread basket (great home-made bread, btw), we all would have left hungry - and it's not like we have huge appetites to begin with. The blame I think is two-fold: First, many of the dishes were protein-heavy, with very little in the way of carbs. This is regrettable, as the one significant starch I do recall (a side of potatoes in a Djion vinaigrette) was phenomenal. Second, there was way too much downtime between some of the courses. Easily 20-25 minutes passed between some of the courses. Had the intervals been a bit shorter, I think we would have been okay.Not to say that service wasn't exemplary. As soon as we entered service was fantastic. Water was constantly topped off, fresh cutlery was brought out every meal, and the table was kept spotless. Presumably the bottleneck was in the kitchen. That being said, the actual food when it came was superb. Of the seven dishes, four consisted of seafood (herring, mussles, tuna, some white fish), two of meat (veal and sweetbreads, duck two ways), and dessert (ice cream and cookie, shared baba au rhum cake). I'd try to describe them in more detail, but would be doing them an injustice. The food was outstanding - I just wish there were more of it.Next time I think a better strategy would be to order a few dishes à la carte, and share those. I saw some tables adopting this strategy and the serving sizes seemed substantial. It would also eliminate some of the waiting between courses.8/30 ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What did the character look like?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I'm not an HBO subscriber.  I didn't really know anything about &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; either.  But it looked like a good show, so I bought the DVD set.I was blown away!  From the very first moments of the pilot, I was hooked.  The opening theme music is one of the best ever composed for a television series, and the opening credits are fascinating -- so much so that there's a featurette on the DVD just about the making of the opening credit sequence.Then there are the characters.  These are not two-dimensional sitcom charicatures; they are very rounded, deep, complicated people.  They actually seem like real people (and a LOT like my own family).Add the acting to that -- what a great cast!  Every single principal actor on this show is terrific.  As an ensemble, they equal more than the sum of their parts.That writing!  These are well-crafted episodes.  Each episode tells a couple of self-contained stories, but there's some serialism going on, too, which keeps you coming back for more.And direction... very fresh and stylized, not the standard TV dramedy fare.I'm gushing, I know.  This is GOOD TV.  OK, Nate and Brenda's constant cycle of blowing up and making up gets a little tiring, but that's really the only complaint that I have (other than the fact that Season 2 doesn't have a release date yet).

There is a lot of places to dine,shop and explore galleries in that area too. Cable car is 1 block away and that one takes you right to Fishermans Wharf. You really don't need your car in this city, just take mass transit everywhere and if you get the $11.00 daily pass at the visitor center it is well worth it.

      "Corresponding review: My daughter and I stayed 5 nights at Hotel Whitcomb during her spring break. My husband suggested this hotel because of the special rate at the time and the fact that the BART stopped right outside. When we saw the pictures on their web site we were both psyched to stay there. It turned out to be a great choice for us. I didn't want the bother of parking a rental car in SF. We took the BART from the airport and got a Muni Passport which allowed us unlimited rides on the cable cars, buses and the subway. Right outside the hotel was a stop for buses and cable cars, down stairs was the subway. With the map the hotel provided we could find our way to anywhere in the city. The hotel was charming, clean and except for sirens, quiet. The staff was friendly. Our room was small, but the beds were super comfortable. We joked that we had a suite. The closet was really big and we used it for a changing room. The only thing we missed in the room was a coffee maker. However, there is a Starbucks downstairs and a couple of places the next block down that had even better coffe and a great selection of doughnuts. There are good places to eat across the street - Sam's Diner, Munch Haven Cafe. Even though I am from a tiny town, I never felt threatened outside. A special bonus - Wicked was playing at the Orpheum on the next block across the street. We both had a fantastic time!I highly recommend this hotel. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

You will start reading The Maze Runner and forget to eat, bath, or feed your cats. You will not be able to put the book down until the very last page. I cannot stress this enough. I know because it took all of my self-control to take breaks from reading. The Maze Runner had everything that I love in a good science fiction novel, thought provoking scenarios, engaging characters, and a suspenseful plot.The voice of Thomas sucked me into the story from the very beginning. I wanted to find out what was going to happen to him. Why are all these boys trapped in a maze? What does it all mean? Who put them there? I felt like I was standing right beside Thomas while he was trying to figure all of these things out. I also thought that the secondary characters were vivid and believable. Chuck in particular was one of my other favorite secondary characters. I hate to use the word secondary to describe Chuck, because he was such a huge part of the story. I just loved him though.The fast pace of The Maze Runner kept me rapidly turning to pages. The half animal half technology Grievers scared the bejesus out of me! As I read along each new discovery left me feeling shocked, disturbed, and very often both.The ending just about killed me. I'm dying to get my hands on the sequel now to find out what happens. Some big questions are unanswered, but most are not.

      "Corresponding review: I always wanted to try this place and finally did for winterlicous 2018. Hands down the worst restaurant I tried during the event.  The atmosphere inside and the interior is quite nice. The waitress was quite nice and attentive as she could be. It was quite busy.  The chairs were really small and it was hard to put a large winter coat on them. We didn't want to leave our jackets outside the restaurant on these coat racks they had. We were scared anyone could just walk by and steal our expensive jackets. Normally the point of winterlicous is to get people to come to your restaurant and present them with some of your best so them come back. This was hardly the case.  The pre-fix price of $53 for dinner was fair but if I came here normally and had to pay 100$ per person I can imagine i would be super super angry for what I got. The food came super slow but I get it was winterlicous. We had the winterlicous soup to start and it tasted bland and watered down. We also order the french onion soup. It was awful, was so sour and did not have enough cheese. A frozen french onion soup taste better. The steak for the main was so tough at med rare. The fries however were quite good actually. The other was chicken on mash potatoes. The chicken was cooked well and was juicy but the mash potatoes was watery like a soup. For desert we had creme brulee. We kinda had a bad feeling when the table next to us only took one bite. The custard tasted ok but the sugar on top was almost a 1/4inch thick.  Definitely pass on this place and just get a street dog with poutine. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. The only good thing was free parking for dinner really. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: The MoKo Slim-Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7Before I give my reasons why, let me note this case comes with no instructions, like so many products. Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical.

      "Corresponding question: How about smoke point?\n",
      "Corresponding review: I'm just not impressed with coconut oil.  You can use it like other vegetable oils, but you have to work around its properties.I am impressed with the quality of Jarrow coconut oil.  The product I received was very fresh, contains no sediment or solids, and the packaging was very airtight.  I tasted it straight out of the jar, and it is flavorless.  It does not impart coconut or any other flavor to food.  It's simply a fat you can use like most others.  But coconut oil is expensive, regardless of brand.  I'd been considering buying some to try before it was offered in Vine, so I've seen prices.Coconut oil is solid at room temperature.  The label recommends refrigeration after opening.  Unless you plan ahead and remove it from the fridge well before you cook, you'll have to chisel it out.  It gets really hard when it's cold.  I didn't know this, so that makes me an uninformed (till now) consumer.  I've used it for baking and it's fine, really.  If you don't mind getting up at 5:00 am to remove it from the fridge and let it soften!I haven't tried doing this yet, but I think that when making a ganache that I want to set quickly, I could add a little coconut oil to my cream and chocolate.  Just a little bit should help it set up without affecting the flavor or texture.  Not too much, though.  It will turn the ganache into a candy shell, I'm sure.If you passionately love coconut oil, this will not disappoint.  If you're merely curious, well, there are other things to be curious about.

      "Corresponding review: It's hard not to compare Kraft's fiber bar with the original \"Fiber One\" bars.  If one was comparing, I'd say Fiber One bars are still better.  For one thing, even though Kraft's mocha flavored granola bar has one percent more daily fiber than a Fiber One bar, the saturated fat content is higher.  Also, there doesn't seem to be much granola in this granola bar; instead, it's covered in chocolate and...I think a peanut butter/mocha flavored strip with the consistency of whipped frosting.  Though I don't taste anything new here, except more sugar, the bars don't taste too bad.  However, I would still take Fiber One over South Beach, as the saturated fat level is pretty high, and the size of the bar is smaller.  When taste is comparable, I go for the better nutritional or monetary value. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Katniss is sixteen, but she has yet to experience the slightest intimacy beyond a familial kiss. As the oldest child in the family, she is tasked with the unenviable job of providing for her mother and younger sister when her father perishes in a mining accident. Set in the near future, most residents of Pan-Am are forced to subsist through utter capitulation to the Capitol's whims. The only ways out are to break the law and hunt outside the district (which carries a capital sentence), or prove victorious in the annual Hunger Games.Being forced to live off the land for years, pairing her natural talent for archery with Gale's instinct for setting snares, they eke out a comfortable, if arduous, existence in District 12. Until Katniss' sister Prim is chosen for the Hunger Games, despite only having one slip with her name in the Reaping. I expect this \"coincidence\" to play a prominent role in the following two books.The bulk of the book is fast-paced, with occasional flashbacks to Katniss' past, and how she seems to be the only lady in the family without a talent or desire for treating the sick and injured. Although she has her father's talent for calling out to the Mockingjays, she chooses not to do so, preferring the practical and more immediate fruits of hunting and gathering.The Games themselves are never dull (particularly because the Game Masters can't afford to rely on nature and the killer instincts of the contestants to whittle down the numbers). Any tribute who gets complacent or is lucky enough to enjoy a cushy half-day or two is immediately beset by traps, lack of resources, or anything else that could lie in store for them (including genetically engineered killing machines). They know their lives are not held in high esteem by the Capitol, and the only way to increase one's chances of survival is to appeal to one's sponsors, a task that becomes exponentially more difficult the longer the Games continue, and the more delirious the betting becomes.The Hunger Games is excellently written and paced, and while Katniss' introspective analyses of her personality, her emotions and her life can get tedious at times, it doesn't adversely affect the experience overall. It soon becomes apparent that while Katniss is unfamiliar and uneasy with the concepts of romance and love, she still has a firm grasp on her humanity. Love has been abandoned, alone in her soul, but it is far from dead. A sense of duty, obligation and debt has replaced it, and she hates being in anyone's debt (although she soon learns that this is sometimes unavoidable, and some debts can never be repaid, at least not in the conventional sense).

      "Corresponding review: Late review. Indulged here for dinner during Winterlicious 2014! I've never been here before that so I'm not sure how they are on a regular basis with a regular menu. Needless to say, it is on the pricier end. To start off, the ambience and atmosphere is lovely! Really nice for a special occasion - the view more than makes up for the corporate feel of the TD Tower. When we arrived (party of 4 - two couples), our table wasn't ready. They took our coats and suggested we wait in the bar area. That was fine. We grabbed a table and enjoyed the view while sipping on our drinks. They had 4 beers on hand and we ordered one of each. Nothing memorable, the usual Steamwhistle etc. We were then taken to our table about 15 minutes later. We were served an amuse bouche of bread and condiments - tasty but unmemorable. Here is what we ordered: - Butternut Squash Soup - Cured Rainbow Trout- Pork Terrine - Roasted Chicken  - Braised Beef Ribs/Steak - Carrot Cake - Three Milk Cake  (I think) The soup was alright - it tasted something like my mom makes at home; good, but nothing spectacular. The trout was sashimi style. I found the portion rather small, but it was tasty. Again, it didn't stand out for me. My SO was the only one who ordered the pork terrine, and I found it absolutely phenomenal! He said it tasted like fish or SPAM, but I personally loved both the texture and flavour and the accompanying fruity condiments. The roasted chicken was fabulous! I adored every bite - 2 of us got this dish and we both loved it. The chicken was so soft and tender, the sauces were flavourful and complimented the dish well, and the vegetables and I believe wild rice or risotto, were a nice touch. It was perfect! Again, the portion was on the smaller end, but alongside the appetizer, I was getting full by this point. My SO and the other diner got the beef dish. It came with a braised short rib and mashed potatoes. Wow. This dish was out of this world! We all loved the beef and it was done to a perfect medium/medium-rare. The carrot cake was perfect and my only complaint was that I wished the portion was bigger. The cream cheese 'icing'  they served alongside it was absolutely heavenly. My SO got the three milk cake, I believe. I wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't terrible, but it did not stand out to me. Service was flawless - our water glasses were kept full, the servers were gracious and unpretentious. One of them even noticed us trying to take pictures and offered to take one of the group for us! They were friendly and very precise - they cleared our tables with manners and skill. No complaints with them. Presentation was top notch. Everything came looking extremely pretty. Our only complaint was that we wished the portions were a little bigger. The two males in our group noted that they could go for another round of the entrees. I was moderately full - if my dessert had been even 1/2 a size bigger, I would have reached that mark. My other friend, who is a very light eater, was completely satisfied. All in all, I loved my experience at Canoe. I think I would definitely go back to try their regular menu, however, it is quite pricey, so perhaps for a special occasion. The entrees were quite truly amazing, and the desserts satisfying. The appetizers have potential, but could use some work. Maybe we are big eaters or it was simply Winterlicious, but I believe the portions could have been slightly larger. Definitely recommend this place though! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I was skeptical when ordering this product.  I had never before heard of TP-Link.  Because this router is available for less than $70, I had real reservations on just how well it would do in a real working environment.I was pleasantly surprised to find out from a performance standpoint, there was not much difference from the \"big names.\"  After EASY set-up, I began using the router in my small insurance agency.  I didn't tell my Office Manager I had changed routers.  I waited for her reaction.  She never even noticed the difference between the TP-Link N600 and our previous Netgear WNDR4500 which, incidentally, was double the price.The wireless performance of the N600 router turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Even though the router is less than half the cost of some of the \"big name\" routers, there is no lacking of performance whatsoever.  You may not like the look of a router with its external antennas, but there is no doubt the router utilizes the design effectively.  The speed is outstanding and the range is exceptional.All in all, TP-Link N600 comes equipped with ALMOST every major function you could want from a router.  It is MISSING a 'Guest Network' feature which allows you to have separate security and access restrictions for guests accessing your network.  Other than that, I believe this router can certainly compete with the \"big names.\"Adding to my satisfaction, the TP-Link N600 comes complete with a 2-year limited warranty.The TP-Link N600 is a very impressive dual-band router that performs like the \"big names\" but costs about half the price.  It doesn't have the most attractive interface, but it isn't lacking many features.  Those looking for a best buy for the money, the TP-Link N600 is really hard to beat. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: I made the mistake, apparently like every other person who has left a review about this hotel, of going without checking the other reviews left online. But THIS review is more about what they put us through AFTERWARDS then during....(not putting any names in this review, but now, we knew that entire hierarchy by name, as you will later see)Our stay was starting on August 11th. My two friends and I arrive after our flight at 11AM, so we decide to drop off our bags in the lobby and go around town before check-in at 3PM. We get to the lobby, and my friend, who has major asthma, asked if we could get a peek at one of the rooms. The woman at the front desk was kind enough to give us a key to take a look. We opened the door, and the smell of mold hit us in the face like a brick. My friend was nervous, because she didn't think she'd be able to handle the smell, but we decided to wait to see if the room they gave us was the same, or if this was just a fluke.3PM comes, and we check in, and the room that they gave us is the same exact way. My friend already starts to feel a slight reaction, so we go to the lobby to see about a switch. According to the same rude and horrible Indian guy that everyone else describes working there, there are no other rooms available. I say that she cannot stay in that room because of her condition, and he says that his supervisor will be in in a half hour, if we want to talk to him. I said that we'll wait to ask about a refund, and suddenly, he had another room for us to check out. THAT room, however, was even worse! The door didn't lock fully, a light didn't work, the mold smell was even worse, and there was what seemed to be cat hair all over the single chair and the countertops. Now, the fun starts:We go back downstairs, and we say that we absolutely cannot stay there, and we want a refund. Apparently, we booked the non-refundable rate, the money was already taken out and there was nothing we could do about it. I said that we'd wait for his supervisor, and suddenly, he wasn't coming in anymore that night. He wasn't answering his phone, and we had to call back the next day between 9AM and 1PM. (Obviously, with the line of people out the door still waiting to check in with the horrible service, they didn't want any problems in the lobby) We said fine, and spent the rest of our first day in San Francisco looking for another hotel.Tthe next day, the woman who answered the lobby phone said that the supervisor DID come in about an hour after we left, and got off at 8:30 in the morning, RIGHT BEFORE we were supposed to call. I asked when he was going to be in again...she said 3:00. I asked for the manager's number. She gave me a different phone number and a different name, and asked me to explain the situation to her. I did, and she suddenly said that the supervisor wasn't coming in anymore today because he was tired, and I don't have to call the manager, but to deal with the supervisor, who will be in TOMORROW between 10 and 2. I called back at 3, and again, the Indian guy answered, and said the supervisor was around, but it was hard for him to get to a phone, and he'll do his best, but he doesn't know if he'll be able to talk. To make a long story longer, the supervisor never called back. We called the manager several times, and we are STILL being given the run around to get a refund for our non-stay. This hotel is the worst experience I have EVER had in ANY hotel. It should be closed down immediately, people should not be subjected to it, and the people at the front desk and in charge should never be allowed to work in a hotel again. I spent a total of about 20 minutes in this place, and the stress and trouble they are causing us now to get a refund for a time we didn't spend there is awful (especially since it's not like we didn't show up....we did, and they expect to just take our money for nothing, because WE have some sort of decency and hope to sleep comfortably without bed bugs, mold, and sickness).Please avoid this hotel at all costs....I would give it negative stars if possible......

      "Corresponding review: I was lucky to be able to upgrade my camera kit and spent a lot of time shopping and debating.  I originally was going to get the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but someone in one of the forums suggest I look at this one.  Though I lost a stop of light, I was very much sold on the IS idea (hands shake) and the cost difference between the two allowed me to invest in the Canon 430 EX II flash, which was something else I really needed to invest in, so I decided the trade-off was worth it for my purposes.I've been using the lens now for about a week, experimenting with the IS, the focus, depth of field, etc.  I wanted to be pretty sure I knew what it could do before I wrote a review.Focus and focal range:  my camera focuses very quickly with this lens, and the full-time manual focus is great for those moments when the camera \"guesses wrong\" and focuses on, say, the post beside the bird instead of the bird itself.  I was pleased that 24-105 is workable as an indoor lens on a crop sensor camera.  I didn't run into any \"have to back up to get that picture\" moments so far.  It definitely isn't an ultra-wide lens on a crop sensor body, but can be used comfortably every day.  The zoom works well for the across the room zooms when you're trying to just get the subject's face in the camera, making this a great choice as a walk-around lens for most people photography.Sharpness:  I bought this at the same time as the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens, so I have a much sharper lens (the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II is a definite \"wow\" lens) to compare it to, so I will say this lens is acceptably, moderately sharp without a lot of post-processing.  Not as sharp as the 70-200mm f/2.8L lens (it also costs half as much), but sharper than the kit lens and the 55-250mm lens that I had with my T1i, requiring less post-processing to get a sharp image.  The colors are rich and the contrast is excellent, creating a pleasing image.Build quality and feel: if you are someone coming from the consumer lens category you will immediately notice the difference.  From the weight of the lens to the \"feel\" of the focus and zoom rings and the more quiet, assured zoom you realize there are reasons why L glass costs more beyond just the research and engineering required to make a higher quality image.  The IS also runs more quietly than the IS in the consumer-level lenses.  The lens is built dust and weather resistant, meaning that it can stand up to a little weather here and there, etc.  Additionally it comes with a pouch and lens hood included.  Unlike what I can research about the consumer hoods, the lens hood on L-glass comes with a flocked interior, which absorbs light better than the plain matte-black plastic.I am very pleased with my choice, and would definitely probably do the same thing again without hesitation.  Now I am debating between the 16-35mm f/2.8L II and the 17-40mm f/4L.  Decisions, decisions... ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: C.S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with its seven allegorical books is becoming the latest film franchise. This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch. The most important creature in Narnia is Aslan, the lion.The film is entertaining, well-cast and well-acted, has some great special effects as well as a few hokey ones, the voices of some famous stars, but there's no there there; it lacks the underpinning of a substantive reason for being.William Mosely who plays the older brother is every teenage girl's heartthrob.

      "Corresponding review: This camera is fantastic. I own the Panasonic GF-1, GX-1, LX7 and will continue to use them, however the S95 has proven over and over to be a fantastic pocket sized competitor, even outshining it's 'upgrade' S100 as THE go to camera. Even what would be considered generations past its release date, the S95 continues to show that Canon has made a solid impact on the point and shoot division by showing that it's not only DSLR's that can take stunning photos.I have purchased this camera for my girlfriend, both my sisters own the S95, and we are going to purchase yet another S95 for my mom, who loves taking photos but has an old and again Cybershot.The camera takes extremely sharp photos, works well in low-lighting conditions (with a steady hand of course), has brilliant color reproduction and some of the best video I've seen from a point and shoot. Sometimes it takes better photos than my own cameras, despite the huge price difference. For anyone looking for a compact, high quality camera, get this. New, used, whatever, if you find a bargain deal you'll have found an amazing wingman to save your memories. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding review: Aladdin is true, classic, Disney magic. It has everything I've always wanted from my animated movies: gorgeous visuals, laugh-aloud humour, sing-along songs, an appealing hero, and a heroine little girls can feel good about looking up to. I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. \"One Jump Ahead\", \"Friend Like Me\", and \"Prince Ali\" delight and amuse, while the \"One Jump Ahead\" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping \"A Whole New World\" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years. I recommend this to any Disney fan, anyone with children, and anyone with a kid still lurking somewhere inside herself. It's a true delight! ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "Corresponding question: What is the control grip material?\n",
      "Corresponding review: It is thin enough to fully take advantage of the slimness of the iPad Air while still offering protection when the case is closed. I did have a little trouble getting the latch to release but finally figured out that squeezing the case gets it to release.The slide out feature with two flat prongs is wonderful. I like that so much better than the single slide out piece on the NT 30 that my iPad mini case has. I find the iPad is much more stable when separated from the keyboard. Another handy feature is the little ledges that hold the iPad Air in place at the back of the keyboard when the stand is in the open position.I also really like the full size keys on the keyboard and find it to be very responsive and warms up very quickly.I wish that some kind of screen protection was included but it's easy enough to obtain a screen protector film to protect from scratches.Other than the need for screen protection, I can't really find anything about this case that I don't like.

      "Corresponding review: Using the \"inSSIDer\" tool, this antenna ranked equally with the built-in antenna in my IBM Thinkpad T60 listed a -35dbm antenna signal in the same room as the top-of-the-line DLink 300 \"N\" class WiFi router.However outside, in my car placed this unit on the dashboard, and I was picking up signals from blocks and blocks away.I purchased a 15' USB extension cord to use this, but the signal is not strong enough for the unit to work using the extension.The cord is reasonably long enough, and the full-sized USB connector to your computer is durable given that I've already bumped this connector numerous times.Product design enhancement would be nice if the USB plug mounted flush with the grommet for the wire.  The USB cable sticks out pretty rigidly before the grommet allows the cable to flex around.. ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",

      "review: This book has elicited in me mixed emotions. The story is certainly original. I admit I bought it for the vaguely sci-fi assumption from which it begins to discover that it was more like a romance novel with a literary fiction ending.The way it is written, mixing past, present and future, the narrative technique of the double point of view and the perfectly intertwined mechanism of time travels is definitely remarkable. As well the ability of Niffenegger's prose deserves praise as to capture the reader and make them empathize with the story. She could really make me live the story of Clare and Henry, but especially that of Henry, much more interesting than his wife.Bad, though, for the unnecessarily downhill final part, characterized by a continuous basking in the pain of the male protagonist. I found it sadistic towards the character itself and the readers. From the moment I knew how it would end, around page 300 (but I had a suspicion long before), I almost had no reason to go on. I continued to hope for a twist, because it seemed absurd that in a novel like that the ending would be so obvious so far in advance. But I was disappointed. The last scene is really disturbing. I read in an interview that Niffenegger has written that scene at very first, which is even more disappointing.What can I say? It certainly enriched me in many aspects of the way in which it was written, but I do not know if it was worth reading, given the prolonged bad mood that got me in the end. I want to enjoy myself when I read, not bring myself down.What a pity.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return ANSWERNOTFOUND\n",
